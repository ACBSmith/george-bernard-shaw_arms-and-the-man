<h2><a name="chap01" id="chap01"></a>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p>
To the irreverent—and which of us will claim entire exemption from that
comfortable classification?—there is something very amusing in the
attitude of the orthodox criticism toward Bernard Shaw. He so obviously
disregards all the canons and unities and other things which every well-bred
dramatist is bound to respect that his work is really unworthy of serious
criticism (orthodox). Indeed he knows no more about the <i>dramatic art</i>
than, according to his own story in “The Man of Destiny,” Napoleon
at Tavazzano knew of the <i>Art of War</i>. But both men were successes each in
his way—the latter won victories and the former gained audiences, in the
very teeth of the accepted theories of war and the theatre. Shaw does not know
that it is unpardonable sin to have his characters make long speeches at one
another, apparently thinking that this embargo applies only to long speeches
which consist mainly of bombast and rhetoric. There never was an author who
showed less predilection for a specific medium by which to accomplish his
results. He recognized, early in his days, many things awry in the world and he
assumed the task of mundane reformation with a confident spirit. It seems such
a small job at twenty to set the times aright. He began as an Essayist, but who
reads essays now-a-days?—he then turned novelist with no better success,
for no one would read such preposterous stuff as he chose to emit. He only
succeeded in proving that absolutely rational men and women—although he
has created few of the latter—can be most extremely disagreeable to our
conventional way of thinking.
</p>

<p>
As a last resort, he turned to the stage, not that he cared for the dramatic
art, for no man seems to care less about “Art for Art’s
sake,” being in this a perfect foil to his brilliant compatriot and
contemporary, Wilde. He cast his theories in dramatic forms merely because no
other course except silence or physical revolt was open to him. For a long time
it seemed as if this resource too was doomed to fail him. But finally he has
attained a hearing and now attempts at suppression merely serve to advertise
their victim.
</p>

<p>
It will repay those who seek analogies in literature to compare Shaw with
Cervantes. After a life of heroic endeavor, disappointment, slavery, and
poverty, the author of “Don Quixote” gave the world a serious work
which caused to be laughed off the world’s stage forever the final
vestiges of decadent chivalry.
</p>

<p>
The institution had long been outgrown, but its vernacular continued to be the
speech and to express the thought “of the world and among the
vulgar,” as the quaint, old novelist puts it, just as to-day the novel
intended for the consumption of the unenlightened must deal with peers and
millionaires and be dressed in stilted language. Marvellously he succeeded, but
in a way he least intended. We have not yet, after so many years, determined
whether it is a work to laugh or cry over. “It is our joyfullest modern
book,” says Carlyle, while Landor thinks that “readers who see
nothing more than a burlesque in ‘Don Quixote’ have but shallow
appreciation of the work.”
</p>

<p>
Shaw in like manner comes upon the scene when many of our social usages are
outworn. He sees the fact, announces it, and we burst into guffaws. The
continuous laughter which greets Shaw’s plays arises from a real contrast
in the point of view of the dramatist and his audiences. When Pinero or Jones
describes a whimsical situation we never doubt for a moment that the
author’s point of view is our own and that the abnormal predicament of
his characters appeals to him in the same light as to his audience. With Shaw
this sense of community of feeling is wholly lacking. He describes things as he
sees them, and the house is in a roar. Who is right? If we were really using
our own senses and not gazing through the glasses of convention and romance and
make-believe, should we see things as Shaw does?
</p>

<p>
Must it not cause Shaw to doubt his own or the public’s sanity to hear
audiences laughing boisterously over tragic situations? And yet, if they did
not come to laugh, they would not come at all. Mockery is the price he must pay
for a hearing. Or has he calculated to a nicety the power of reaction? Does he
seek to drive us to aspiration by the portrayal of sordidness, to
disinterestedness by the picture of selfishness, to illusion by
disillusionment? It is impossible to believe that he is unconscious of the
humor of his dramatic situations, yet he stoically gives no sign. He even dares
the charge, terrible in proportion to its truth, which the most serious of us
shrinks from—the lack of a sense of humor. Men would rather have their
integrity impugned.
</p>

<p>
In “Arms and the Man” the subject which occupies the
dramatist’s attention is that survival of
barbarity—militarism—which raises its horrid head from time to time
to cast a doubt on the reality of our civilization. No more hoary superstition
survives than that the donning of a uniform changes the nature of the wearer.
This notion pervades society to such an extent that when we find some soldiers
placed upon the stage acting rationally, our conventionalized senses are
shocked. The only men who have no illusions about war are those who have
recently been there, and, of course, Mr. Shaw, who has no illusions about
anything.
</p>

<p>
It is hard to speak too highly of “Candida.” No equally subtle and
incisive study of domestic relations exists in the English drama. One has to
turn to George Meredith’s “The Egoist” to find such character
dissection. The central note of the play is, that with the true woman, weakness
which appeals to the maternal instinct is more powerful than strength which
offers protection. <i>Candida</i> is quite unpoetic, as, indeed, with rare
exceptions, women are prone to be. They have small delight in poetry, but are
the stuff of which poems and dreams are made. The husband glorying in his
strength but convicted of his weakness, the poet pitiful in his physical
impotence but strong in his perception of truth, the hopelessly de-moralized
manufacturer, the conventional and hence emotional typist make up a group which
the drama of any language may be challenged to rival.
</p>

<p>
In “The Man of Destiny” the object of the dramatist is not so much
the destruction as the explanation of the Napoleonic tradition, which has so
powerfully influenced generation after generation for a century. However the
man may be regarded, he was a miracle. Shaw shows that he achieved his
extraordinary career by suspending, for himself, the pressure of the moral and
conventional atmosphere, while leaving it operative for others. Those who study
this play—extravaganza, that it is—will attain a clearer
comprehension of Napoleon than they can get from all the biographies.
</p>

<p>
“You Never Can Tell” offers an amusing study of the play of social
conventions. The “twins” illustrate the disconcerting effects of
that perfect frankness which would make life intolerable. <i>Gloria</i>
demonstrates the powerlessness of reason to overcome natural instincts. The
idea that parental duties and functions can be fulfilled by the light of such
knowledge as man and woman attain by intuition is brilliantly lampooned.
<i>Crampton</i>, the father, typifies the common superstition that among the
privileges of parenthood are inflexibility, tyranny, and respect, the last
entirely regardless of whether it has been deserved.
</p>

<p>
The waiter, <i>William</i>, is the best illustration of the man “who
knows his place” that the stage has seen. He is the most pathetic figure
of the play. One touch of verisimilitude is lacking; none of the guests gives
him a tip, yet he maintains his urbanity. As Mr. Shaw has not yet visited
America he may be unaware of the improbability of this situation.
</p>

<p>
To those who regard literary men merely as purveyors of amusement for people
who have not wit enough to entertain themselves, Ibsen and Shaw, Maeterlinck
and Gorky must remain enigmas. It is so much pleasanter to ignore than to face
unpleasant realities—to take Riverside Drive and not Mulberry Street as
the exponent of our life and the expression of our civilization. These men are
the sappers and miners of the advancing army of justice. The audience which
demands the truth and despises the contemptible conventions that dominate alike
our stage and our life is daily growing. Shaw and men like him—if indeed
he is not absolutely unique—will not for the future lack a hearing.

<h3><a name="chap03" id="chap03"></a>ACT I</h3>

<p class="stage">
Night. A lady’s bedchamber in Bulgaria, in a small town near the Dragoman
Pass. It is late in November in the year 1885, and through an open window with
a little balcony on the left can be seen a peak of the Balkans, wonderfully
white and beautiful in the starlit snow. The interior of the room is not like
anything to be seen in the east of Europe. It is half rich Bulgarian, half
cheap Viennese. The counterpane and hangings of the bed, the window curtains,
the little carpet, and all the ornamental textile fabrics in the room are
oriental and gorgeous: the paper on the walls is occidental and paltry. Above
the head of the bed, which stands against a little wall cutting off the right
hand corner of the room diagonally, is a painted wooden shrine, blue and gold,
with an ivory image of Christ, and a light hanging before it in a pierced metal
ball suspended by three chains. On the left, further forward, is an ottoman.
The washstand, against the wall on the left, consists of an enamelled iron
basin with a pail beneath it in a painted metal frame, and a single towel on
the rail at the side. A chair near it is Austrian bent wood, with cane seat.
The dressing table, between the bed and the window, is an ordinary pine table,
covered with a cloth of many colors, but with an expensive toilet mirror on it.
The door is on the right; and there is a chest of drawers between the door and
the bed. This chest of drawers is also covered by a variegated native cloth,
and on it there is a pile of paper backed novels, a box of chocolate creams,
and a miniature easel, on which is a large photograph of an extremely handsome
officer, whose lofty bearing and magnetic glance can be felt even from the
portrait. The room is lighted by a candle on the chest of drawers, and another
on the dressing table, with a box of matches beside it.
</p>

<p class="stage">
The window is hinged doorwise and stands wide open, folding back to the left.
Outside a pair of wooden shutters, opening outwards, also stand open. On the
balcony, a young lady, intensely conscious of the romantic beauty of the night,
and of the fact that her own youth and beauty is a part of it, is on the
balcony, gazing at the snowy Balkans. She is covered by a long mantle of furs,
worth, on a moderate estimate, about three times the furniture of her room.
</p>

<p class="stage">
Her reverie is interrupted by her mother, Catherine Petkoff, a woman over
forty, imperiously energetic, with magnificent black hair and eyes, who might
be a very splendid specimen of the wife of a mountain farmer, but is determined
to be a Viennese lady, and to that end wears a fashionable tea gown on all
occasions.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
CATHERINE.<br />
(<i>entering hastily, full of good news</i>). Raina—(<i>she pronounces it
Rah-eena, with the stress on the ee</i>) Raina—(<i>she goes to the bed,
expecting to find Raina there.</i>) Why, where—(<i>Raina looks into the
room.</i>) Heavens! child, are you out in the night air instead of in your bed?
You’ll catch your death. Louka told me you were asleep.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
(<i>coming in</i>). I sent her away. I wanted to be alone. The stars are so
beautiful! What is the matter?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
CATHERINE.<br />
Such news. There has been a battle!
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
(<i>her eyes dilating</i>). Ah! (<i>She throws the cloak on the ottoman, and
comes eagerly to Catherine in her nightgown, a pretty garment, but evidently
the only one she has on.</i>)
</p>

<p class="dialog">
CATHERINE.<br />
A great battle at Slivnitza! A victory! And it was won by Sergius.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
(<i>with a cry of delight</i>). Ah! (<i>Rapturously.</i>) Oh, mother! (<i>Then,
with sudden anxiety</i>) Is father safe?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
CATHERINE.<br />
Of course: he sent me the news. Sergius is the hero of the hour, the idol of
the regiment.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
Tell me, tell me. How was it! (<i>Ecstatically</i>) Oh, mother, mother, mother!
(<i>Raina pulls her mother down on the ottoman; and they kiss one another
frantically.</i>)
</p>

<p class="dialog">
CATHERINE.<br />
(<i>with surging enthusiasm</i>). You can’t guess how splendid it is. A
cavalry charge—think of that! He defied our Russian
commanders—acted without orders—led a charge on his own
responsibility—headed it himself—was the first man to sweep through
their guns. Can’t you see it, Raina; our gallant splendid Bulgarians with
their swords and eyes flashing, thundering down like an avalanche and
scattering the wretched Servian dandies like chaff. And you—you kept
Sergius waiting a year before you would be betrothed to him. Oh, if you have a
drop of Bulgarian blood in your veins, you will worship him when he comes back.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
What will he care for my poor little worship after the acclamations of a whole
army of heroes? But no matter: I am so happy—so proud! (<i>She rises and
walks about excitedly.</i>) It proves that all our ideas were real after all.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
CATHERINE.<br />
(<i>indignantly</i>). Our ideas real! What do you mean?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
Our ideas of what Sergius would do—our patriotism—our heroic
ideals. Oh, what faithless little creatures girls are!—I sometimes used
to doubt whether they were anything but dreams. When I buckled on
Sergius’s sword he looked so noble: it was treason to think of
disillusion or humiliation or failure. And yet—and
yet—(<i>Quickly.</i>) Promise me you’ll never tell him.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
CATHERINE.<br />
Don’t ask me for promises until I know what I am promising.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
Well, it came into my head just as he was holding me in his arms and looking
into my eyes, that perhaps we only had our heroic ideas because we are so fond
of reading Byron and Pushkin, and because we were so delighted with the opera
that season at Bucharest. Real life is so seldom like that—indeed never,
as far as I knew it then. (<i>Remorsefully.</i>) Only think, mother, I doubted
him: I wondered whether all his heroic qualities and his soldiership might not
prove mere imagination when he went into a real battle. I had an uneasy fear
that he might cut a poor figure there beside all those clever Russian officers.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
CATHERINE.<br />
A poor figure! Shame on you! The Servians have Austrian officers who are just
as clever as our Russians; but we have beaten them in every battle for all
that.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
(<i>laughing and sitting down again</i>). Yes, I was only a prosaic little
coward. Oh, to think that it was all true—that Sergius is just as
splendid and noble as he looks—that the world is really a glorious world
for women who can see its glory and men who can act its romance! What
happiness! what unspeakable fulfilment! Ah! (<i>She throws herself on her knees
beside her mother and flings her arms passionately round her. They are
interrupted by the entry of Louka, a handsome, proud girl in a pretty Bulgarian
peasant’s dress with double apron, so defiant that her servility to Raina
is almost insolent. She is afraid of Catherine, but even with her goes as far
as she dares. She is just now excited like the others; but she has no sympathy
for Raina’s raptures and looks contemptuously at the ecstasies of the two
before she addresses them.</i>)
</p>

<p class="dialog">
LOUKA.<br />
If you please, madam, all the windows are to be closed and the shutters made
fast. They say there may be shooting in the streets. (<i>Raina and Catherine
rise together, alarmed.</i>) The Servians are being chased right back through
the pass; and they say they may run into the town. Our cavalry will be after
them; and our people will be ready for them you may be sure, now that they are
running away. (<i>She goes out on the balcony and pulls the outside shutters
to; then steps back into the room.</i>)
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
I wish our people were not so cruel. What glory is there in killing wretched
fugitives?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
CATHERINE.<br />
(<i>business-like, her housekeeping instincts aroused</i>). I must see that
everything is made safe downstairs.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
(<i>to Louka</i>). Leave the shutters so that I can just close them if I hear
any noise.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
CATHERINE.<br />
(<i>authoritatively, turning on her way to the door</i>). Oh, no, dear, you
must keep them fastened. You would be sure to drop off to sleep and leave them
open. Make them fast, Louka.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
LOUKA.<br />
Yes, madam. (<i>She fastens them.</i>)
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
Don’t be anxious about me. The moment I hear a shot, I shall blow out the
candles and roll myself up in bed with my ears well covered.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
CATHERINE.<br />
Quite the wisest thing you can do, my love. Good-night.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
Good-night. (<i>They kiss one another, and Raina’s emotion comes back for
a moment.</i>) Wish me joy of the happiest night of my life—if only there
are no fugitives.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
CATHERINE.<br />
Go to bed, dear; and don’t think of them. (<i>She goes out.</i>)
</p>

<p class="dialog">
LOUKA.<br />
(<i>secretly, to Raina</i>). If you would like the shutters open, just give
them a push like this. (<i>She pushes them: they open: she pulls them to
again.</i>) One of them ought to be bolted at the bottom; but the bolt’s
gone.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
(<i>with dignity, reproving her</i>). Thanks, Louka; but we must do what we are
told. (<i>Louka makes a grimace.</i>) Good-night.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
LOUKA.<br />
(<i>carelessly</i>). Good-night. (<i>She goes out, swaggering.</i>)
</p>

<p class="stage">
(<i>Raina, left alone, goes to the chest of drawers, and adores the portrait
there with feelings that are beyond all expression. She does not kiss it or
press it to her breast, or shew it any mark of bodily affection; but she takes
it in her hands and elevates it like a priestess.</i>)
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
(<i>looking up at the picture with worship.</i>) Oh, I shall never be unworthy
of you any more, my hero—never, never, never.
</p>

<p class="stage">
(<i>She replaces it reverently, and selects a novel from the little pile of
books. She turns over the leaves dreamily; finds her page; turns the book
inside out at it; and then, with a happy sigh, gets into bed and prepares to
read herself to sleep. But before abandoning herself to fiction, she raises her
eyes once more, thinking of the blessed reality and murmurs</i>)
</p>

<p class="dialog">
My hero! my hero!
</p>

<p class="stage">
(<i>A distant shot breaks the quiet of the night outside. She starts,
listening; and two more shots, much nearer, follow, startling her so that she
scrambles out of bed, and hastily blows out the candle on the chest of drawers.
Then, putting her fingers in her ears, she runs to the dressing-table and blows
out the light there, and hurries back to bed. The room is now in darkness:
nothing is visible but the glimmer of the light in the pierced ball before the
image, and the starlight seen through the slits at the top of the shutters. The
firing breaks out again: there is a startling fusillade quite close at hand.
Whilst it is still echoing, the shutters disappear, pulled open from without,
and for an instant the rectangle of snowy starlight flashes out with the figure
of a man in black upon it. The shutters close immediately and the room is dark
again. But the silence is now broken by the sound of panting. Then there is a
scrape; and the flame of a match is seen in the middle of the room.</i>)
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
(<i>crouching on the bed</i>). Who’s there? (<i>The match is out
instantly.</i>) Who’s there? Who is that?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
A MAN’S VOICE.<br />
(<i>in the darkness, subduedly, but threateningly</i>). Sh—sh!
Don’t call out or you’ll be shot. Be good; and no harm will happen
to you. (<i>She is heard leaving her bed, and making for the door.</i>) Take
care, there’s no use in trying to run away. Remember, if you raise your
voice my pistol will go off. (<i>Commandingly.</i>) Strike a light and let me
see you. Do you hear? (<i>Another moment of silence and darkness. Then she is
heard retreating to the dressing-table. She lights a candle, and the mystery is
at an end. A man of about 35, in a deplorable plight, bespattered with mud and
blood and snow, his belt and the strap of his revolver case keeping together
the torn ruins of the blue coat of a Servian artillery officer. As far as the
candlelight and his unwashed, unkempt condition make it possible to judge, he
is a man of middling stature and undistinguished appearance, with strong neck
and shoulders, a roundish, obstinate looking head covered with short crisp
bronze curls, clear quick blue eyes and good brows and mouth, a hopelessly
prosaic nose like that of a strong-minded baby, trim soldierlike carriage and
energetic manner, and with all his wits about him in spite of his desperate
predicament—even with a sense of humor of it, without, however, the least
intention of trifling with it or throwing away a chance. He reckons up what he
can guess about Raina—her age, her social position, her character, the
extent to which she is frightened—at a glance, and continues, more
politely but still most determinedly</i>) Excuse my disturbing you; but you
recognise my uniform—Servian. If I’m caught I shall be killed.
(<i>Determinedly.</i>) Do you understand that?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
Yes.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
MAN.<br />
Well, I don’t intend to get killed if I can help it. (<i>Still more
determinedly.</i>) Do you understand that? (<i>He locks the door with a
snap.</i>)
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
(<i>disdainfully</i>). I suppose not. (<i>She draws herself up superbly, and
looks him straight in the face, saying with emphasis</i>) Some soldiers, I
know, are afraid of death.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
MAN.<br />
(<i>with grim goodhumor</i>). All of them, dear lady, all of them, believe me.
It is our duty to live as long as we can, and kill as many of the enemy as we
can. Now if you raise an alarm—
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
(<i>cutting him short</i>). You will shoot me. How do you know that I am afraid
to die?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
MAN.<br />
(<i>cunningly</i>). Ah; but suppose I don’t shoot you, what will happen
then? Why, a lot of your cavalry—the greatest blackguards in your
army—will burst into this pretty room of yours and slaughter me here like
a pig; for I’ll fight like a demon: they shan’t get me into the
street to amuse themselves with: I know what they are. Are you prepared to
receive that sort of company in your present undress? (<i>Raina, suddenly
conscious of her nightgown, instinctively shrinks and gathers it more closely
about her. He watches her, and adds, pitilessly</i>) It’s rather scanty,
eh? (<i>She turns to the ottoman. He raises his pistol instantly, and
cries</i>) Stop! (<i>She stops.</i>) Where are you going?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
(<i>with dignified patience</i>). Only to get my cloak.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
MAN.<br />
(<i>darting to the ottoman and snatching the cloak</i>). A good idea. No:
I’ll keep the cloak: and you will take care that nobody comes in and sees
you without it. This is a better weapon than the pistol. (<i>He throws the
pistol down on the ottoman.</i>)
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
(<i>revolted</i>). It is not the weapon of a gentleman!
</p>

<p class="dialog">
MAN.<br />
It’s good enough for a man with only you to stand between him and death.
(<i>As they look at one another for a moment, Raina hardly able to believe that
even a Servian officer can be so cynically and selfishly unchivalrous, they are
startled by a sharp fusillade in the street. The chill of imminent death hushes
the man’s voice as he adds</i>) Do you hear? If you are going to bring
those scoundrels in on me you shall receive them as you are. (<i>Raina meets
his eye with unflinching scorn. Suddenly he starts, listening. There is a step
outside. Someone tries the door, and then knocks hurriedly and urgently at it.
Raina looks at the man, breathless. He throws up his head with the gesture of a
man who sees that it is all over with him, and, dropping the manner which he
has been assuming to intimidate her, flings the cloak to her, exclaiming,
sincerely and kindly</i>) No use: I’m done for. Quick! wrap yourself up:
they’re coming!
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
(<i>catching the cloak eagerly</i>). Oh, thank you. (<i>She wraps herself up
with great relief. He draws his sabre and turns to the door, waiting.</i>)
</p>

<p class="dialog">
LOUKA.<br />
(<i>outside, knocking</i>). My lady, my lady! Get up, quick, and open the door.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
(<i>anxiously</i>). What will you do?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
MAN.<br />
(<i>grimly</i>). Never mind. Keep out of the way. It will not last long.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
(<i>impulsively</i>). I’ll help you. Hide yourself, oh, hide yourself,
quick, behind the curtain. (<i>She seizes him by a torn strip of his sleeve,
and pulls him towards the window.</i>)
</p>

<p class="dialog">
MAN.<br />
(<i>yielding to her</i>). There is just half a chance, if you keep your head.
Remember: nine soldiers out of ten are born fools. (<i>He hides behind the
curtain, looking out for a moment to say, finally</i>) If they find me, I
promise you a fight—a devil of a fight! (<i>He disappears. Raina takes
off the cloak and throws it across the foot of the bed. Then with a sleepy,
disturbed air, she opens the door. Louka enters excitedly.</i>)
</p>

<p class="dialog">
LOUKA.<br />
A man has been seen climbing up the water-pipe to your balcony—a Servian.
The soldiers want to search for him; and they are so wild and drunk and
furious. My lady says you are to dress at once.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
(<i>as if annoyed at being disturbed</i>). They shall not search here. Why have
they been let in?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
CATHERINE.<br />
(<i>coming in hastily</i>). Raina, darling, are you safe? Have you seen anyone
or heard anything?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
I heard the shooting. Surely the soldiers will not dare come in here?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
CATHERINE.<br />
I have found a Russian officer, thank Heaven: he knows Sergius. (<i>Speaking
through the door to someone outside.</i>) Sir, will you come in now! My
daughter is ready.
</p>

<p class="stage">
(<i>A young Russian officer, in Bulgarian uniform, enters, sword in hand.</i>)
</p>

<p class="dialog">
THE OFFICER.<br />
(<i>with soft, feline politeness and stiff military carriage</i>). Good
evening, gracious lady; I am sorry to intrude, but there is a fugitive hiding
on the balcony. Will you and the gracious lady your mother please to withdraw
whilst we search?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
(<i>petulantly</i>). Nonsense, sir, you can see that there is no one on the
balcony. (<i>She throws the shutters wide open and stands with her back to the
curtain where the man is hidden, pointing to the moonlit balcony. A couple of
shots are fired right under the window, and a bullet shatters the glass
opposite Raina, who winks and gasps, but stands her ground, whilst Catherine
screams, and the officer rushes to the balcony.</i>)
</p>

<p class="dialog">
THE OFFICER.<br />
(<i>on the balcony, shouting savagely down to the street</i>). Cease firing
there, you fools: do you hear? Cease firing, damn you. (<i>He glares down for a
moment; then turns to Raina, trying to resume his polite manner.</i>) Could
anyone have got in without your knowledge? Were you asleep?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
No, I have not been to bed.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
THE OFFICER.<br />
(<i>impatiently, coming back into the room</i>). Your neighbours have their
heads so full of runaway Servians that they see them everywhere.
(<i>Politely.</i>) Gracious lady, a thousand pardons. Good-night. (<i>Military
bow, which Raina returns coldly. Another to Catherine, who follows him out.
Raina closes the shutters. She turns and sees Louka, who has been watching the
scene curiously.</i>)
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
Don’t leave my mother, Louka, whilst the soldiers are here. (<i>Louka
glances at Raina, at the ottoman, at the curtain; then purses her lips
secretively, laughs to herself, and goes out. Raina follows her to the door,
shuts it behind her with a slam, and locks it violently. The man immediately
steps out from behind the curtain, sheathing his sabre, and dismissing the
danger from his mind in a businesslike way.</i>)
</p>

<p class="dialog">
MAN.<br />
A narrow shave; but a miss is as good as a mile. Dear young lady, your servant
until death. I wish for your sake I had joined the Bulgarian army instead of
the Servian. I am not a native Servian.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
(<i>haughtily</i>). No, you are one of the Austrians who set the Servians on to
rob us of our national liberty, and who officer their army for them. We hate
them!
</p>

<p class="dialog">
MAN.<br />
Austrian! not I. Don’t hate me, dear young lady. I am only a Swiss,
fighting merely as a professional soldier. I joined Servia because it was
nearest to me. Be generous: you’ve beaten us hollow.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
Have I not been generous?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
MAN.<br />
Noble!—heroic! But I’m not saved yet. This particular rush will
soon pass through; but the pursuit will go on all night by fits and starts. I
must take my chance to get off during a quiet interval. You don’t mind my
waiting just a minute or two, do you?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
Oh, no: I am sorry you will have to go into danger again. (<i>Motioning towards
ottoman.</i>) Won’t you sit—(<i>She breaks off with an
irrepressible cry of alarm as she catches sight of the pistol. The man, all
nerves, shies like a frightened horse.</i>)
</p>

<p class="dialog">
MAN.<br />
(<i>irritably</i>). Don’t frighten me like that. What is it?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
Your pistol! It was staring that officer in the face all the time. What an
escape!
</p>

<p class="dialog">
MAN.<br />
(<i>vexed at being unnecessarily terrified</i>). Oh, is that all?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
(<i>staring at him rather superciliously, conceiving a poorer and poorer
opinion of him, and feeling proportionately more and more at her ease with
him</i>). I am sorry I frightened you. (<i>She takes up the pistol and hands it
to him.</i>) Pray take it to protect yourself against me.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
MAN.<br />
(<i>grinning wearily at the sarcasm as he takes the pistol</i>). No use, dear
young lady: there’s nothing in it. It’s not loaded. (<i>He makes a
grimace at it, and drops it disparagingly into his revolver case.</i>)
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
Load it by all means.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
MAN.<br />
I’ve no ammunition. What use are cartridges in battle? I always carry
chocolate instead; and I finished the last cake of that yesterday.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
(<i>outraged in her most cherished ideals of manhood</i>). Chocolate! Do you
stuff your pockets with sweets—like a schoolboy—even in the field?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
MAN.<br />
Yes. Isn’t it contemptible?
</p>

<p class="stage">
(<i>Raina stares at him, unable to utter her feelings. Then she sails away
scornfully to the chest of drawers, and returns with the box of confectionery
in her hand.</i>)
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
Allow me. I am sorry I have eaten them all except these. (<i>She offers him the
box.</i>)
</p>

<p class="dialog">
MAN.<br />
(<i>ravenously</i>). You’re an angel! (<i>He gobbles the comfits.</i>)
Creams! Delicious! (<i>He looks anxiously to see whether there are any more.
There are none. He accepts the inevitable with pathetic goodhumor, and says,
with grateful emotion</i>) Bless you, dear lady. You can always tell an old
soldier by the inside of his holsters and cartridge boxes. The young ones carry
pistols and cartridges; the old ones, grub. Thank you. (<i>He hands back the
box. She snatches it contemptuously from him and throws it away. This impatient
action is so sudden that he shies again.</i>) Ugh! Don’t do things so
suddenly, gracious lady. Don’t revenge yourself because I frightened you
just now.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
(<i>superbly</i>). Frighten me! Do you know, sir, that though I am only a
woman, I think I am at heart as brave as you.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
MAN.<br />
I should think so. You haven’t been under fire for three days as I have.
I can stand two days without shewing it much; but no man can stand three days:
I’m as nervous as a mouse. (<i>He sits down on the ottoman, and takes his
head in his hands.</i>) Would you like to see me cry?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
(<i>quickly</i>). No.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
MAN.<br />
If you would, all you have to do is to scold me just as if I were a little boy
and you my nurse. If I were in camp now they’d play all sorts of tricks
on me.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
(<i>a little moved</i>). I’m sorry. I won’t scold you. (<i>Touched
by the sympathy in her tone, he raises his head and looks gratefully at her:
she immediately draws back and says stiffly</i>) You must excuse me: our
soldiers are not like that. (<i>She moves away from the ottoman.</i>)
</p>

<p class="dialog">
MAN.<br />
Oh, yes, they are. There are only two sorts of soldiers: old ones and young
ones. I’ve served fourteen years: half of your fellows never smelt powder
before. Why, how is it that you’ve just beaten us? Sheer ignorance of the
art of war, nothing else. (<i>Indignantly.</i>) I never saw anything so
unprofessional.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
(<i>ironically</i>). Oh, was it unprofessional to beat you?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
MAN.<br />
Well, come, is it professional to throw a regiment of cavalry on a battery of
machine guns, with the dead certainty that if the guns go off not a horse or
man will ever get within fifty yards of the fire? I couldn’t believe my
eyes when I saw it.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
(<i>eagerly turning to him, as all her enthusiasm and her dream of glory rush
back on her</i>). Did you see the great cavalry charge? Oh, tell me about it.
Describe it to me.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
MAN.<br />
You never saw a cavalry charge, did you?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
How could I?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
MAN.<br />
Ah, perhaps not—of course. Well, it’s a funny sight. It’s
like slinging a handful of peas against a window pane: first one comes; then
two or three close behind him; and then all the rest in a lump.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
(<i>her eyes dilating as she raises her clasped hands ecstatically</i>). Yes,
first One!—the bravest of the brave!
</p>

<p class="dialog">
MAN.<br />
(<i>prosaically</i>). Hm! you should see the poor devil pulling at his horse.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
Why should he pull at his horse?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
MAN.<br />
(<i>impatient of so stupid a question</i>). It’s running away with him,
of course: do you suppose the fellow wants to get there before the others and
be killed? Then they all come. You can tell the young ones by their wildness
and their slashing. The old ones come bunched up under the number one guard:
they know that they are mere projectiles, and that it’s no use trying to
fight. The wounds are mostly broken knees, from the horses cannoning together.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
Ugh! But I don’t believe the first man is a coward. I believe he is a
hero!
</p>

<p class="dialog">
MAN.<br />
(<i>goodhumoredly</i>). That’s what you’d have said if you’d
seen the first man in the charge to-day.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
(<i>breathless</i>). Ah, I knew it! Tell me—tell me about him.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
MAN.<br />
He did it like an operatic tenor—a regular handsome fellow, with flashing
eyes and lovely moustache, shouting a war-cry and charging like Don Quixote at
the windmills. We nearly burst with laughter at him; but when the sergeant ran
up as white as a sheet, and told us they’d sent us the wrong cartridges,
and that we couldn’t fire a shot for the next ten minutes, we laughed at
the other side of our mouths. I never felt so sick in my life, though
I’ve been in one or two very tight places. And I hadn’t even a
revolver cartridge—nothing but chocolate. We’d no
bayonets—nothing. Of course, they just cut us to bits. And there was Don
Quixote flourishing like a drum major, thinking he’d done the cleverest
thing ever known, whereas he ought to be courtmartialled for it. Of all the
fools ever let loose on a field of battle, that man must be the very maddest.
He and his regiment simply committed suicide—only the pistol missed fire,
that’s all.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
(<i>deeply wounded, but steadfastly loyal to her ideals</i>). Indeed! Would you
know him again if you saw him?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
MAN.<br />
Shall I ever forget him. (<i>She again goes to the chest of drawers. He watches
her with a vague hope that she may have something else for him to eat. She
takes the portrait from its stand and brings it to him.</i>)
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
That is a photograph of the gentleman—the patriot and hero—to whom
I am betrothed.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
MAN.<br />
(<i>looking at it</i>). I’m really very sorry. (<i>Looking at her.</i>)
Was it fair to lead me on? (<i>He looks at the portrait again.</i>) Yes:
that’s him: not a doubt of it. (<i>He stifles a laugh.</i>)
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
(<i>quickly</i>). Why do you laugh?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
MAN.<br />
(<i>shamefacedly, but still greatly tickled</i>). I didn’t laugh, I
assure you. At least I didn’t mean to. But when I think of him charging
the windmills and thinking he was doing the finest thing—(<i>chokes with
suppressed laughter</i>).
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
(<i>sternly</i>). Give me back the portrait, sir.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
MAN.<br />
(<i>with sincere remorse</i>). Of course. Certainly. I’m really very
sorry. (<i>She deliberately kisses it, and looks him straight in the face,
before returning to the chest of drawers to replace it. He follows her,
apologizing.</i>) Perhaps I’m quite wrong, you know: no doubt I am. Most
likely he had got wind of the cartridge business somehow, and knew it was a
safe job.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
That is to say, he was a pretender and a coward! You did not dare say that
before.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
MAN.<br />
(<i>with a comic gesture of despair</i>). It’s no use, dear lady: I
can’t make you see it from the professional point of view. (<i>As he
turns away to get back to the ottoman, the firing begins again in the
distance.</i>)
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
(<i>sternly, as she sees him listening to the shots</i>). So much the better
for you.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
MAN.<br />
(<i>turning</i>). How?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
You are my enemy; and you are at my mercy. What would I do if I were a
professional soldier?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
MAN.<br />
Ah, true, dear young lady: you’re always right. I know how good you have
been to me: to my last hour I shall remember those three chocolate creams. It
was unsoldierly; but it was angelic.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
(<i>coldly</i>). Thank you. And now I will do a soldierly thing. You cannot
stay here after what you have just said about my future husband; but I will go
out on the balcony and see whether it is safe for you to climb down into the
street. (<i>She turns to the window.</i>)
</p>

<p class="dialog">
MAN.<br />
(<i>changing countenance</i>). Down that waterpipe! Stop! Wait! I can’t!
I daren’t! The very thought of it makes me giddy. I came up it fast
enough with death behind me. But to face it now in cold blood!—(<i>He
sinks on the ottoman.</i>) It’s no use: I give up: I’m beaten. Give
the alarm. (<i>He drops his head in his hands in the deepest dejection.</i>)
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
(<i>disarmed by pity</i>). Come, don’t be disheartened. (<i>She stoops
over him almost maternally: he shakes his head.</i>) Oh, you are a very poor
soldier—a chocolate cream soldier. Come, cheer up: it takes less courage
to climb down than to face capture—remember that.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
MAN.<br />
(<i>dreamily, lulled by her voice</i>). No, capture only means death; and death
is sleep—oh, sleep, sleep, sleep, undisturbed sleep! Climbing down the
pipe means doing something—exerting myself—thinking! Death ten
times over first.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
(<i>softly and wonderingly, catching the rhythm of his weariness</i>). Are you
so sleepy as that?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
MAN.<br />
I’ve not had two hours’ undisturbed sleep since the war began.
I’m on the staff: you don’t know what that means. I haven’t
closed my eyes for thirty-six hours.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
(<i>desperately</i>). But what am I to do with you.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
MAN.<br />
(<i>staggering up</i>). Of course I must do something. (<i>He shakes himself;
pulls himself together; and speaks with rallied vigour and courage.</i>) You
see, sleep or no sleep, hunger or no hunger, tired or not tired, you can always
do a thing when you know it must be done. Well, that pipe must be got
down—(<i>He hits himself on the chest, and adds</i>)—Do you hear
that, you chocolate cream soldier? (<i>He turns to the window.</i>)
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
(<i>anxiously</i>). But if you fall?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
MAN.<br />
I shall sleep as if the stones were a feather bed. Good-bye. (<i>He makes
boldly for the window, and his hand is on the shutter when there is a terrible
burst of firing in the street beneath.</i>)
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
(<i>rushing to him</i>). Stop! (<i>She catches him by the shoulder, and turns
him quite round.</i>) They’ll kill you.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
MAN.<br />
(<i>coolly, but attentively</i>). Never mind: this sort of thing is all in my
day’s work. I’m bound to take my chance. (<i>Decisively.</i>) Now
do what I tell you. Put out the candles, so that they shan’t see the
light when I open the shutters. And keep away from the window, whatever you do.
If they see me, they’re sure to have a shot at me.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
(<i>clinging to him</i>). They’re sure to see you: it’s bright
moonlight. I’ll save you—oh, how can you be so indifferent? You
want me to save you, don’t you?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
MAN.<br />
I really don’t want to be troublesome. (<i>She shakes him in her
impatience.</i>) I am not indifferent, dear young lady, I assure you. But how
is it to be done?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
Come away from the window—please. (<i>She coaxes him back to the middle
of the room. He submits humbly. She releases him, and addresses him
patronizingly.</i>) Now listen. You must trust to our hospitality. You do not
yet know in whose house you are. I am a Petkoff.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
MAN.<br />
What’s that?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
(<i>rather indignantly</i>). I mean that I belong to the family of the
Petkoffs, the richest and best known in our country.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
MAN.<br />
Oh, yes, of course. I beg your pardon. The Petkoffs, to be sure. How stupid of
me!
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
You know you never heard of them until this minute. How can you stoop to
pretend?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
MAN.<br />
Forgive me: I’m too tired to think; and the change of subject was too
much for me. Don’t scold me.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
I forgot. It might make you cry. (<i>He nods, quite seriously. She pouts and
then resumes her patronizing tone.</i>) I must tell you that my father holds
the highest command of any Bulgarian in our army. He is (<i>proudly</i>) a
Major.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
MAN.<br />
(<i>pretending to be deeply impressed</i>). A Major! Bless me! Think of that!
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
You shewed great ignorance in thinking that it was necessary to climb up to the
balcony, because ours is the only private house that has two rows of windows.
There is a flight of stairs inside to get up and down by.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
MAN.<br />
Stairs! How grand! You live in great luxury indeed, dear young lady.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
Do you know what a library is?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
MAN.<br />
A library? A roomful of books.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
Yes, we have one, the only one in Bulgaria.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
MAN.<br />
Actually a real library! I should like to see that.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
(<i>affectedly</i>). I tell you these things to shew you that you are not in
the house of ignorant country folk who would kill you the moment they saw your
Servian uniform, but among civilized people. We go to Bucharest every year for
the opera season; and I have spent a whole month in Vienna.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
MAN.<br />
I saw that, dear young lady. I saw at once that you knew the world.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
Have you ever seen the opera of Ernani?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
MAN.<br />
Is that the one with the devil in it in red velvet, and a soldier’s
chorus?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
(<i>contemptuously</i>). No!
</p>

<p class="dialog">
MAN.<br />
(<i>stifling a heavy sigh of weariness</i>). Then I don’t know it.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
I thought you might have remembered the great scene where Ernani, flying from
his foes just as you are tonight, takes refuge in the castle of his bitterest
enemy, an old Castilian noble. The noble refuses to give him up. His guest is
sacred to him.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
MAN.<br />
(<i>quickly waking up a little</i>). Have your people got that notion?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
(<i>with dignity</i>). My mother and I can understand that notion, as you call
it. And if instead of threatening me with your pistol as you did, you had
simply thrown yourself as a fugitive on our hospitality, you would have been as
safe as in your father’s house.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
MAN.<br />
Quite sure?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
(<i>turning her back on him in disgust.</i>) Oh, it is useless to try and make
you understand.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
MAN.<br />
Don’t be angry: you see how awkward it would be for me if there was any
mistake. My father is a very hospitable man: he keeps six hotels; but I
couldn’t trust him as far as that. What about YOUR father?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
He is away at Slivnitza fighting for his country. I answer for your safety.
There is my hand in pledge of it. Will that reassure you? (<i>She offers him
her hand.</i>)
</p>

<p class="dialog">
MAN.<br />
(<i>looking dubiously at his own hand</i>). Better not touch my hand, dear
young lady. I must have a wash first.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
(<i>touched</i>). That is very nice of you. I see that you are a gentleman.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
MAN.<br />
(<i>puzzled</i>). Eh?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
You must not think I am surprised. Bulgarians of really good
standing—people in OUR position—wash their hands nearly every day.
But I appreciate your delicacy. You may take my hand. (<i>She offers it
again.</i>)
</p>

<p class="dialog">
MAN.<br />
(<i>kissing it with his hands behind his back</i>). Thanks, gracious young
lady: I feel safe at last. And now would you mind breaking the news to your
mother? I had better not stay here secretly longer than is necessary.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
If you will be so good as to keep perfectly still whilst I am away.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
MAN.<br />
Certainly. (<i>He sits down on the ottoman.</i>)
</p>

<p class="stage">
(<i>Raina goes to the bed and wraps herself in the fur cloak. His eyes close.
She goes to the door, but on turning for a last look at him, sees that he is

</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
(<i>at the door</i>). You are not going asleep, are you? (<i>He murmurs
inarticulately: she runs to him and shakes him.</i>) Do you hear? Wake up: you
are falling asleep.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
MAN.<br />
Eh? Falling aslee—? Oh, no, not the least in the world: I was only
thinking. It’s all right: I’m wide awake.

<p class="dialog">

reluctantly.</i>) All the time, mind.

</p>

<p class="stage">
(<i>Raina looks doubtfully at him. He smiles foolishly. She goes reluctantly,

Nothing keeps me awake except danger—remember
that—(<i>intently</i>) danger, danger, danger, dan— Where’s
danger? Must find it. (<i>He starts of vaguely around the room in search of
it.</i>) What am I looking for? Sleep—danger—don’t know.
(<i>He stumbles against the bed.</i>) Ah, yes: now I know. All right now.
I’m to go to bed, but not to sleep—be sure not to
sleep—because of danger. Not to lie down, either, only sit down. (<i>He
sits on the bed. A blissful expression comes into his face.</i>) Ah! (<i>With a
happy sigh he sinks back at full length; lifts his boots into the bed with a
final effort; and falls fast asleep instantly.</i>)
</p>

<p class="stage">

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />

<p class="dialog">
CATHERINE.<br />

following and standing opposite her on the right.</i>) He’s fast asleep.
The brute!

(<i>anxiously</i>). Sh!

him sleep.

<h3><a name="chap04" id="chap04"></a>ACT II</h3>

<p class="stage">
The sixth of March, 1886. In the garden of major Petkoff’s house. It is a
fine spring morning; and the garden looks fresh and pretty. Beyond the paling
the tops of a couple of minarets can be seen, shewing that there is a valley
there, with the little town in it. A few miles further the Balkan mountains
rise and shut in the view. Within the garden the side of the house is seen on
the right, with a garden door reached by a little flight of steps. On the left
the stable yard, with its gateway, encroaches on the garden. There are fruit
bushes along the paling and house, covered with washing hung out to dry. A path
runs by the house, and rises by two steps at the corner where it turns out of
the right along the front. In the middle a small table, with two bent wood
chairs at it, is laid for breakfast with Turkish coffee pot, cups, rolls, etc.;
but the cups have been used and the bread broken. There is a wooden garden seat
against the wall on the left.
</p>

<p class="stage">
Louka, smoking a cigaret, is standing between the table and the house, turning
her back with angry disdain on a man-servant who is lecturing her. He is a
middle-aged man of cool temperament and low but clear and keen intelligence,
with the complacency of the servant who values himself on his rank in
servility, and the imperturbability of the accurate calculator who has no
illusions. He wears a white Bulgarian costume jacket with decorated border,
sash, wide knickerbockers, and decorated gaiters. His head is shaved up to the
crown, giving him a high Japanese forehead. His name is Nicola.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
NICOLA.<br />
Be warned in time, Louka: mend your manners. I know the mistress. She is so
grand that she never dreams that any servant could dare to be disrespectful to
her; but if she once suspects that you are defying her, out you go.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
LOUKA.<br />
I do defy her. I will defy her. What do I care for her?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
NICOLA.<br />
If you quarrel with the family, I never can marry you. It’s the same as
if you quarrelled with me!
</p>

<p class="dialog">
LOUKA.<br />
You take her part against me, do you?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
NICOLA.<br />
(<i>sedately</i>). I shall always be dependent on the good will of the family.
When I leave their service and start a shop in Sofia, their custom will be half
my capital: their bad word would ruin me.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
LOUKA.<br />
You have no spirit. I should like to see them dare say a word against me!
</p>

<p class="dialog">
NICOLA.<br />
(<i>pityingly</i>). I should have expected more sense from you, Louka. But
you’re young, you’re young!
</p>

<p class="dialog">
LOUKA.<br />
Yes; and you like me the better for it, don’t you? But I know some family
secrets they wouldn’t care to have told, young as I am. Let them quarrel
with me if they dare!
</p>

<p class="dialog">
NICOLA.<br />
(<i>with compassionate superiority</i>). Do you know what they would do if they
heard you talk like that?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
LOUKA.<br />
What could they do?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
NICOLA.<br />
Discharge you for untruthfulness. Who would believe any stories you told after
that? Who would give you another situation? Who in this house would dare be
seen speaking to you ever again? How long would your father be left on his
little farm? (<i>She impatiently throws away the end of her cigaret, and stamps
on it.</i>) Child, you don’t know the power such high people have over
the like of you and me when we try to rise out of our poverty against them.
(<i>He goes close to her and lowers his voice.</i>) Look at me, ten years in
their service. Do you think I know no secrets? I know things about the mistress
that she wouldn’t have the master know for a thousand levas. I know
things about him that she wouldn’t let him hear the last of for six
months if I blabbed them to her. I know things about Raina that would break off
her match with Sergius if—
</p>

<p class="dialog">
LOUKA.<br />
(<i>turning on him quickly</i>). How do you know? I never told you!
</p>

<p class="dialog">
NICOLA.<br />
(<i>opening his eyes cunningly</i>). So that’s your little secret, is it?
I thought it might be something like that. Well, you take my advice, and be
respectful; and make the mistress feel that no matter what you know or
don’t know, they can depend on you to hold your tongue and serve the
family faithfully. That’s what they like; and that’s how
you’ll make most out of them.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
LOUKA.<br />
(<i>with searching scorn</i>). You have the soul of a servant, Nicola.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
NICOLA.<br />
(<i>complacently</i>). Yes: that’s the secret of success in service.
</p>

<p class="stage">
(<i>A loud knocking with a whip handle on a wooden door, outside on the left,
is heard.</i>)
</p>

<p class="dialog">
MALE VOICE OUTSIDE.<br />
Hollo! Hollo there! Nicola!
</p>

<p class="dialog">
LOUKA.<br />
Master! back from the war!
</p>

<p class="dialog">
NICOLA.<br />
(<i>quickly</i>). My word for it, Louka, the war’s over. Off with you and
get some fresh coffee. (<i>He runs out into the stable yard.</i>)
</p>

<p class="dialog">
LOUKA.<br />
(<i>as she puts the coffee pot and the cups upon the tray, and carries it into
the house</i>). You’ll never put the soul of a servant into me.
</p>

<p class="stage">
(<i>Major Petkoff comes from the stable yard, followed by Nicola. He is a
cheerful, excitable, insignificant, unpolished man of about 50, naturally
unambitious except as to his income and his importance in local society, but
just now greatly pleased with the military rank which the war has thrust on him
as a man of consequence in his town. The fever of plucky patriotism which the
Servian attack roused in all the Bulgarians has pulled him through the war; but
he is obviously glad to be home again.</i>)
</p>

<p class="dialog">
PETKOFF.<br />
(<i>pointing to the table with his whip</i>). Breakfast out here, eh?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
NICOLA.<br />
Yes, sir. The mistress and Miss Raina have just gone in.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
PETKOFF.<br />
(<i>fitting down and taking a roll</i>). Go in and say I’ve come; and get
me some fresh coffee.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
NICOLA.<br />
It’s coming, sir. (<i>He goes to the house door. Louka, with fresh
coffee, a clean cup, and a brandy bottle on her tray meets him.</i>) Have you
told the mistress?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
LOUKA.<br />
Yes: she’s coming.
</p>

<p class="stage">
(<i>Nicola goes into the house. Louka brings the coffee to the table.</i>)
</p>

<p class="dialog">
PETKOFF.<br />
Well, the Servians haven’t run away with you, have they?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
LOUKA.<br />
No, sir.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
PETKOFF.<br />
That’s right. Have you brought me some cognac?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
LOUKA.<br />
(<i>putting the bottle on the table</i>). Here, sir.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
PETKOFF.<br />
That’s right. (<i>He pours some into his coffee.</i>)
</p>

<p class="stage">
(<i>Catherine who has at this early hour made only a very perfunctory toilet,
and wears a Bulgarian apron over a once brilliant, but now half worn out red
dressing gown, and a colored handkerchief tied over her thick black hair, with
Turkish slippers on her bare feet, comes from the house, looking astonishingly
handsome and stately under all the circumstances. Louka goes into the
house.</i>)
</p>

<p class="dialog">
CATHERINE.<br />
My dear Paul, what a surprise for us. (<i>She stoops over the back of his chair
to kiss him.</i>) Have they brought you fresh coffee?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
PETKOFF.<br />
Yes, Louka’s been looking after me. The war’s over. The treaty was
signed three days ago at Bucharest; and the decree for our army to demobilize
was issued yesterday.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
CATHERINE.<br />
(<i>springing erect, with flashing eyes</i>). The war over! Paul: have you let
the Austrians force you to make peace?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
PETKOFF.<br />
(<i>submissively</i>). My dear: they didn’t consult me. What could
<i>I</i> do? (<i>She sits down and turns away from him.</i>) But of course we
saw to it that the treaty was an honorable one. It declares peace—
</p>

<p class="dialog">
CATHERINE.<br />
(<i>outraged</i>). Peace!
</p>

<p class="dialog">
PETKOFF.<br />
(<i>appeasing her</i>).—but not friendly relations: remember that. They
wanted to put that in; but I insisted on its being struck out. What more could
I do?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
CATHERINE.<br />
You could have annexed Servia and made Prince Alexander Emperor of the Balkans.
That’s what I would have done.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
PETKOFF.<br />
I don’t doubt it in the least, my dear. But I should have had to subdue
the whole Austrian Empire first; and that would have kept me too long away from
you. I missed you greatly.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
CATHERINE.<br />
(<i>relenting</i>). Ah! (<i>Stretches her hand affectionately across the table
to squeeze his.</i>)
</p>

<p class="dialog">
PETKOFF.<br />
And how have you been, my dear?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
CATHERINE.<br />
Oh, my usual sore throats, that’s all.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
PETKOFF.<br />
(<i>with conviction</i>). That comes from washing your neck every day.
I’ve often told you so.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
CATHERINE.<br />
Nonsense, Paul!
</p>

<p class="dialog">
PETKOFF.<br />
(<i>over his coffee and cigaret</i>). I don’t believe in going too far
with these modern customs. All this washing can’t be good for the health:
it’s not natural. There was an Englishman at Phillipopolis who used to
wet himself all over with cold water every morning when he got up. Disgusting!
It all comes from the English: their climate makes them so dirty that they have
to be perpetually washing themselves. Look at my father: he never had a bath in
his life; and he lived to be ninety-eight, the healthiest man in Bulgaria. I
don’t mind a good wash once a week to keep up my position; but once a day
is carrying the thing to a ridiculous extreme.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
CATHERINE.<br />
You are a barbarian at heart still, Paul. I hope you behaved yourself before
all those Russian officers.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
PETKOFF.<br />
I did my best. I took care to let them know that we had a library.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
CATHERINE.<br />
Ah; but you didn’t tell them that we have an electric bell in it? I have
had one put up.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
PETKOFF.<br />
What’s an electric bell?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
CATHERINE.<br />
You touch a button; something tinkles in the kitchen; and then Nicola comes up.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
PETKOFF.<br />
Why not shout for him?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
CATHERINE.<br />
Civilized people never shout for their servants. I’ve learnt that while
you were away.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
PETKOFF.<br />
Well, I’ll tell you something I’ve learnt, too. Civilized people
don’t hang out their washing to dry where visitors can see it; so
you’d better have all that (<i>indicating the clothes on the bushes</i>)
put somewhere else.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
CATHERINE.<br />
Oh, that’s absurd, Paul: I don’t believe really refined people
notice such things.
</p>

<p class="stage">
(<i>Someone is heard knocking at the stable gates.</i>)
</p>

<p class="dialog">
PETKOFF.<br />
There’s Sergius. (<i>Shouting.</i>) Hollo, Nicola!
</p>

<p class="dialog">
CATHERINE.<br />
Oh, don’t shout, Paul: it really isn’t nice.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
PETKOFF.<br />
Bosh! (<i>He shouts louder than before.</i>) Nicola!
</p>

<p class="dialog">
NICOLA.<br />
(<i>appearing at the house door</i>). Yes, sir.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
PETKOFF.<br />
If that is Major Saranoff, bring him round this way. (<i>He pronounces the name
with the stress on the second syllable—Sarah-noff.</i>)
</p>

<p class="dialog">
NICOLA.<br />
Yes, sir. (<i>He goes into the stable yard.</i>)
</p>

<p class="dialog">
PETKOFF.<br />
You must talk to him, my dear, until Raina takes him off our hands. He bores my
life out about our not promoting him—over my head, mind you.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
CATHERINE.<br />
He certainly ought to be promoted when he marries Raina. Besides, the country
should insist on having at least one native general.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
PETKOFF.<br />
Yes, so that he could throw away whole brigades instead of regiments.
It’s no use, my dear: he has not the slightest chance of promotion until
we are quite sure that the peace will be a lasting one.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
NICOLA.<br />
(<i>at the gate, announcing</i>). Major Sergius Saranoff! (<i>He goes into the
house and returns presently with a third chair, which he places at the table.
He then withdraws.</i>)
</p>

<p class="stage">
(<i>Major Sergius Saranoff, the original of the portrait in Raina’s room,
is a tall, romantically handsome man, with the physical hardihood, the high
spirit, and the susceptible imagination of an untamed mountaineer chieftain.
But his remarkable personal distinction is of a characteristically civilized
type. The ridges of his eyebrows, curving with a ram’s-horn twist round
the marked projections at the outer corners, his jealously observant eye, his
nose, thin, keen, and apprehensive in spite of the pugnacious high bridge and
large nostril, his assertive chin, would not be out of place in a Paris salon.
In short, the clever, imaginative barbarian has an acute critical faculty which
has been thrown into intense activity by the arrival of western civilization in
the Balkans; and the result is precisely what the advent of nineteenth-century
thought first produced in England: to-wit, Byronism. By his brooding on the
perpetual failure, not only of others, but of himself, to live up to his
imaginative ideals, his consequent cynical scorn for humanity, the jejune
credulity as to the absolute validity of his ideals and the unworthiness of the
world in disregarding them, his wincings and mockeries under the sting of the
petty disillusions which every hour spent among men brings to his infallibly
quick observation, he has acquired the half tragic, half ironic air, the
mysterious moodiness, the suggestion of a strange and terrible history that has
left him nothing but undying remorse, by which Childe Harold fascinated the
grandmothers of his English contemporaries. Altogether it is clear that here or
nowhere is Raina’s ideal hero. Catherine is hardly less enthusiastic, and
much less reserved in shewing her enthusiasm. As he enters from the stable
gate, she rises effusively to greet him. Petkoff is distinctly less disposed to
make a fuss about him.</i>)
</p>

<p class="dialog">
PETKOFF.<br />
Here already, Sergius. Glad to see you!
</p>

<p class="dialog">
CATHERINE.<br />
My dear Sergius!(<i>She holds out both her hands.</i>)
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SERGIUS.<br />
(<i>kissing them with scrupulous gallantry</i>). My dear mother, if I may call
you so.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
PETKOFF.<br />
(<i>drily</i>). Mother-in-law, Sergius; mother-in-law! Sit down, and have some
coffee.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SERGIUS.<br />
Thank you, none for me. (<i>He gets away from the table with a certain distaste
for Petkoff’s enjoyment of it, and posts himself with conscious grace
against the rail of the steps leading to the house.</i>)
</p>

<p class="dialog">
CATHERINE.<br />
You look superb—splendid. The campaign has improved you. Everybody here
is mad about you. We were all wild with enthusiasm about that magnificent
cavalry charge.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SERGIUS.<br />
(<i>with grave irony</i>). Madam: it was the cradle and the grave of my
military reputation.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
CATHERINE.<br />
How so?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SERGIUS.<br />
I won the battle the wrong way when our worthy Russian generals were losing it
the right way. That upset their plans, and wounded their self-esteem. Two of
their colonels got their regiments driven back on the correct principles of
scientific warfare. Two major-generals got killed strictly according to
military etiquette. Those two colonels are now major-generals; and I am still a
simple major.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
CATHERINE.<br />
You shall not remain so, Sergius. The women are on your side; and they will see
that justice is done you.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SERGIUS.<br />
It is too late. I have only waited for the peace to send in my resignation.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
PETKOFF.<br />
(<i>dropping his cup in his amazement</i>). Your resignation!
</p>

<p class="dialog">
CATHERINE.<br />
Oh, you must withdraw it!
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SERGIUS.<br />
(<i>with resolute, measured emphasis, folding his arms</i>). I never withdraw!
</p>

<p class="dialog">
PETKOFF.<br />
(<i>vexed</i>). Now who could have supposed you were going to do such a thing?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SERGIUS.<br />
(<i>with fire</i>). Everyone that knew me. But enough of myself and my affairs.
How is Raina; and where is Raina?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
(<i>suddenly coming round the corner of the house and standing at the top of
the steps in the path</i>). Raina is here. (<i>She makes a charming picture as
they all turn to look at her. She wears an underdress of pale green silk,
draped with an overdress of thin ecru canvas embroidered with gold. On her head
she wears a pretty Phrygian cap of gold tinsel. Sergius, with an exclamation of
pleasure, goes impulsively to meet her. She stretches out her hand: he drops
chivalrously on one knee and kisses it.</i>)
</p>

<p class="dialog">
PETKOFF.<br />
(<i>aside to Catherine, beaming with parental pride</i>). Pretty, isn’t
it? She always appears at the right moment.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
CATHERINE.<br />
(<i>impatiently</i>). Yes: she listens for it. It is an abominable habit.
</p>

<p class="stage">
(<i>Sergius leads Raina forward with splendid gallantry, as if she were a
queen. When they come to the table, she turns to him with a bend of the head;
he bows; and thus they separate, he coming to his place, and she going behind
her father’s chair.</i>)
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
(<i>stooping and kissing her father</i>). Dear father! Welcome home!
</p>

<p class="dialog">
PETKOFF.<br />
(<i>patting her cheek</i>). My little pet girl. (<i>He kisses her; she goes to
the chair left by Nicola for Sergius, and sits down.</i>)
</p>

<p class="dialog">
CATHERINE.<br />
And so you’re no longer a soldier, Sergius.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SERGIUS.<br />
I am no longer a soldier. Soldiering, my dear madam, is the coward’s art
of attacking mercilessly when you are strong, and keeping out of harm’s
way when you are weak. That is the whole secret of successful fighting. Get
your enemy at a disadvantage; and never, on any account, fight him on equal
terms. Eh, Major!
</p>

<p class="dialog">
PETKOFF.<br />
They wouldn’t let us make a fair stand-up fight of it. However, I suppose
soldiering has to be a trade like any other trade.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SERGIUS.<br />
Precisely. But I have no ambition to succeed as a tradesman; so I have taken
the advice of that bagman of a captain that settled the exchange of prisoners
with us at Peerot, and given it up.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
PETKOFF.<br />
What, that Swiss fellow? Sergius: I’ve often thought of that exchange
since. He over-reached us about those horses.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SERGIUS.<br />
Of course he over-reached us. His father was a hotel and livery stable keeper;
and he owed his first step to his knowledge of horse-dealing. (<i>With mock
enthusiasm.</i>) Ah, he was a soldier—every inch a soldier! If only I had
bought the horses for my regiment instead of foolishly leading it into danger,
I should have been a field-marshal now!
</p>

<p class="dialog">
CATHERINE.<br />
A Swiss? What was he doing in the Servian army?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
PETKOFF.<br />
A volunteer of course—keen on picking up his profession.
(<i>Chuckling.</i>) We shouldn’t have been able to begin fighting if
these foreigners hadn’t shewn us how to do it: we knew nothing about it;
and neither did the Servians. Egad, there’d have been no war without
them.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
Are there many Swiss officers in the Servian Army?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
PETKOFF.<br />
No—all Austrians, just as our officers were all Russians. This was the
only Swiss I came across. I’ll never trust a Swiss again. He cheated
us—humbugged us into giving him fifty able bodied men for two hundred
confounded worn out chargers. They weren’t even eatable!
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SERGIUS.<br />
We were two children in the hands of that consummate soldier, Major: simply two
innocent little children.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
What was he like?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
CATHERINE.<br />
Oh, Raina, what a silly question!
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SERGIUS.<br />
He was like a commercial traveller in uniform. Bourgeois to his boots.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
PETKOFF.<br />
(<i>grinning</i>). Sergius: tell Catherine that queer story his friend told us
about him—how he escaped after Slivnitza. You remember?—about his
being hid by two women.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SERGIUS.<br />
(<i>with bitter irony</i>). Oh, yes, quite a romance. He was serving in the
very battery I so unprofessionally charged. Being a thorough soldier, he ran
away like the rest of them, with our cavalry at his heels. To escape their
attentions, he had the good taste to take refuge in the chamber of some
patriotic young Bulgarian lady. The young lady was enchanted by his persuasive
commercial traveller’s manners. She very modestly entertained him for an
hour or so and then called in her mother lest her conduct should appear
unmaidenly. The old lady was equally fascinated; and the fugitive was sent on
his way in the morning, disguised in an old coat belonging to the master of the
house, who was away at the war.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
(<i>rising with marked stateliness</i>). Your life in the camp has made you
coarse, Sergius. I did not think you would have repeated such a story before
me. (<i>She turns away coldly.</i>)
</p>

<p class="dialog">
CATHERINE.<br />
(<i>also rising</i>). She is right, Sergius. If such women exist, we should be
spared the knowledge of them.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
PETKOFF.<br />
Pooh! nonsense! what does it matter?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SERGIUS.<br />
(<i>ashamed</i>). No, Petkoff: I was wrong. (<i>To Raina, with earnest
humility.</i>) I beg your pardon. I have behaved abominably. Forgive me, Raina.
(<i>She bows reservedly.</i>) And you, too, madam. (<i>Catherine bows
graciously and sits down. He proceeds solemnly, again addressing Raina.</i>)
The glimpses I have had of the seamy side of life during the last few months
have made me cynical; but I should not have brought my cynicism
here—least of all into your presence, Raina. I—(<i>Here, turning to
the others, he is evidently about to begin a long speech when the Major
interrupts him.</i>)
</p>

<p class="dialog">
PETKOFF.<br />
Stuff and nonsense, Sergius. That’s quite enough fuss about nothing: a
soldier’s daughter should be able to stand up without flinching to a
little strong conversation. (<i>He rises.</i>) Come: it’s time for us to
get to business. We have to make up our minds how those three regiments are to
get back to Phillipopolis:—there’s no forage for them on the Sofia
route. (<i>He goes towards the house.</i>) Come along. (<i>Sergius is about to
follow him when Catherine rises and intervenes.</i>)
</p>

<p class="dialog">
CATHERINE.<br />
Oh, Paul, can’t you spare Sergius for a few moments? Raina has hardly
seen him yet. Perhaps I can help you to settle about the regiments.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SERGIUS.<br />
(<i>protesting</i>). My dear madam, impossible: you—
</p>

<p class="dialog">
CATHERINE.<br />
(<i>stopping him playfully</i>). You stay here, my dear Sergius: there’s
no hurry. I have a word or two to say to Paul. (<i>Sergius instantly bows and
steps back.</i>) Now, dear (<i>taking Petkoff’s arm</i>), come and see

Oh, very well, very well. (<i>They go into the house together affectionately.

SERGIUS.<br />
My queen! (<i>He kisses her on the forehead with holy awe.</i>)
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
How I have envied you, Sergius! You have been out in the world, on the field of
battle, able to prove yourself there worthy of any woman in the world; whilst I
have had to sit at home inactive,—dreaming—useless—doing
nothing that could give me the right to call myself worthy of any man.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SERGIUS.<br />
Dearest, all my deeds have been yours. You inspired me. I have gone through the
war like a knight in a tournament with his lady looking on at him!
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
And you have never been absent from my thoughts for a moment. (<i>Very
solemnly.</i>) Sergius: I think we two have found the higher love. When I think
of you, I feel that I could never do a base deed, or think an ignoble thought.

My lady, and my saint! (<i>Clasping her reverently.</i>)

SERGIUS.<br />
Sh—sh! Let me be the worshipper, dear. You little know how unworthy even
the best man is of a girl’s pure passion!
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
I trust you. I love you. You will never disappoint me, Sergius. (<i>Louka is
heard singing within the house. They quickly release each other.</i>) Hush! I
can’t pretend to talk indifferently before her: my heart is too full.
(<i>Louka comes from the house with her tray. She goes to the table, and begins
to clear it, with her back turned to them.</i>) I will go and get my hat; and
then we can go out until lunch time. Wouldn’t you like that?

<p class="dialog">
SERGIUS.<br />
Be quick. If you are away five minutes, it will seem five hours. (<i>Raina runs
to the top of the steps and turns there to exchange a look with him and wave
him a kiss with both hands. He looks after her with emotion for a moment, then
turns slowly away, his face radiant with the exultation of the scene which has
just passed. The movement shifts his field of vision, into the corner of which
there now comes the tail of Louka’s double apron. His eye gleams at once.
He takes a stealthy look at her, and begins to twirl his moustache nervously,
with his left hand akimbo on his hip. Finally, striking the ground with his
heels in something of a cavalry swagger, he strolls over to the left of the
table, opposite her, and says</i>) Louka: do you know what the higher love is?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
LOUKA.<br />
(<i>astonished</i>). No, sir.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SERGIUS.<br />
Very fatiguing thing to keep up for any length of time, Louka. One feels the
need of some relief after it.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
LOUKA.<br />
(<i>innocently</i>). Perhaps you would like some coffee, sir? (<i>She stretches
her hand across the table for the coffee pot.</i>)
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SERGIUS.<br />
(<i>taking her hand</i>). Thank you, Louka.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
LOUKA.<br />
(<i>pretending to pull</i>). Oh, sir, you know I didn’t mean that.
I’m surprised at you!
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SERGIUS.<br />
(<i>coming clear of the table and drawing her with him</i>). I am surprised at
myself, Louka. What would Sergius, the hero of Slivnitza, say if he saw me now?
What would Sergius, the apostle of the higher love, say if he saw me now? What
would the half dozen Sergiuses who keep popping in and out of this handsome
figure of mine say if they caught us here? (<i>Letting go her hand and slipping
his arm dexterously round her waist.</i>) Do you consider my figure handsome,
Louka?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
LOUKA.<br />
Let me go, sir. I shall be disgraced. (<i>She struggles: he holds her
inexorably.</i>) Oh, will you let go?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SERGIUS.<br />
(<i>looking straight into her eyes</i>). No.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
LOUKA.<br />
Then stand back where we can’t be seen. Have you no common sense?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SERGIUS.<br />
Ah, that’s reasonable. (<i>He takes her into the stableyard gateway,
where they are hidden from the house.</i>)
</p>

<p class="dialog">
LOUKA.<br />
(<i>complaining</i>). I may have been seen from the windows: Miss Raina is sure
to be spying about after you.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SERGIUS.<br />
(<i>stung—letting her go</i>). Take care, Louka. I may be worthless
enough to betray the higher love; but do not you insult it.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
LOUKA.<br />
(<i>demurely</i>). Not for the world, sir, I’m sure. May I go on with my
work please, now?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SERGIUS.<br />
(<i>again putting his arm round her</i>). You are a provoking little witch,
Louka. If you were in love with me, would you spy out of windows on me?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
LOUKA.<br />
Well, you see, sir, since you say you are half a dozen different gentlemen all
at once, I should have a great deal to look after.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SERGIUS.<br />
(<i>charmed</i>). Witty as well as pretty. (<i>He tries to kiss her.</i>)
</p>

<p class="dialog">
LOUKA.<br />
(<i>avoiding him</i>). No, I don’t want your kisses. Gentlefolk are all
alike—you making love to me behind Miss Raina’s back, and she doing
the same behind yours.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SERGIUS.<br />
(<i>recoiling a step</i>). Louka!
</p>

<p class="dialog">
LOUKA.<br />
It shews how little you really care!
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SERGIUS.<br />
(<i>dropping his familiarity and speaking with freezing politeness</i>). If our
conversation is to continue, Louka, you will please remember that a gentleman
does not discuss the conduct of the lady he is engaged to with her maid.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
LOUKA.<br />
It’s so hard to know what a gentleman considers right. I thought from
your trying to kiss me that you had given up being so particular.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SERGIUS.<br />
(<i>turning from her and striking his forehead as he comes back into the garden
from the gateway</i>). Devil! devil!
</p>

<p class="dialog">
LOUKA.<br />
Ha! ha! I expect one of the six of you is very like me, sir, though I am only
Miss Raina’s maid. (<i>She goes back to her work at the table, taking no
further notice of him.</i>)
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SERGIUS.<br />
(<i>speaking to himself</i>). Which of the six is the real
man?—that’s the question that torments me. One of them is a hero,
another a buffoon, another a humbug, another perhaps a bit of a blackguard.
(<i>He pauses and looks furtively at Louka, as he adds with deep
bitterness</i>) And one, at least, is a coward—jealous, like all cowards.
(<i>He goes to the table.</i>) Louka.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
LOUKA.<br />
Yes?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SERGIUS.<br />
Who is my rival?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
LOUKA.<br />
You shall never get that out of me, for love or money.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SERGIUS.<br />
Why?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
LOUKA.<br />
Never mind why. Besides, you would tell that I told you; and I should lose my
place.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SERGIUS.<br />
(<i>holding out his right hand in affirmation</i>). No; on the honor of
a—(<i>He checks himself, and his hand drops nerveless as he concludes,
sardonically</i>)—of a man capable of behaving as I have been behaving
for the last five minutes. Who is he?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
LOUKA.<br />
I don’t know. I never saw him. I only heard his voice through the door of
her room.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SERGIUS.<br />
Damnation! How dare you?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
LOUKA.<br />
(<i>retreating</i>). Oh, I mean no harm: you’ve no right to take up my
words like that. The mistress knows all about it. And I tell you that if that
gentleman ever comes here again, Miss Raina will marry him, whether he likes it
or not. I know the difference between the sort of manner you and she put on
before one another and the real manner. (<i>Sergius shivers as if she had
stabbed him. Then, setting his face like iron, he strides grimly to her, and
grips her above the elbows with both bands.</i>)
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SERGIUS.<br />
Now listen you to me!
</p>

<p class="dialog">
LOUKA.<br />
(<i>wincing</i>). Not so tight: you’re hurting me!
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SERGIUS.<br />
That doesn’t matter. You have stained my honor by making me a party to
your eavesdropping. And you have betrayed your mistress—
</p>

<p class="dialog">
LOUKA.<br />
(<i>writhing</i>). Please—
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SERGIUS.<br />
That shews that you are an abominable little clod of common clay, with the soul
of a servant. (<i>He lets her go as if she were an unclean thing, and turns
away, dusting his hands of her, to the bench by the wall, where he sits down
with averted head, meditating gloomily.</i>)
</p>

<p class="dialog">
LOUKA.<br />
(<i>whimpering angrily with her hands up her sleeves, feeling her bruised
arms</i>). You know how to hurt with your tongue as well as with your hands.
But I don’t care, now I’ve found out that whatever clay I’m
made of, you’re made of the same. As for her, she’s a liar; and her
fine airs are a cheat; and I’m worth six of her. (<i>She shakes the pain
off hardily; tosses her head; and sets to work to put the things on the tray.
He looks doubtfully at her once or twice. She finishes packing the tray, and
laps the cloth over the edges, so as to carry all out together. As she stoops
to lift it, he rises.</i>)
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SERGIUS.<br />
Louka! (<i>She stops and looks defiantly at him with the tray in her
hands.</i>) A gentleman has no right to hurt a woman under any circumstances.
(<i>With profound humility, uncovering his head.</i>) I beg your pardon.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
LOUKA.<br />
That sort of apology may satisfy a lady. Of what use is it to a servant?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SERGIUS.<br />
(<i>thus rudely crossed in his chivalry, throws it off with a bitter laugh and
says slightingly</i>). Oh, you wish to be paid for the hurt? (<i>He puts on his
shako, and takes some money from his pocket.</i>)
</p>

<p class="dialog">
LOUKA.<br />
(<i>her eyes filling with tears in spite of herself</i>). No, I want my hurt
made well.

SERGIUS.<br />
(<i>sobered by her tone</i>). How?

<p class="stage">
(<i>She rolls up her left sleeve; clasps her arm with the thumb and fingers of
her right hand; and looks down at the bruise. Then she raises her head and
looks straight at him. Finally, with a superb gesture she presents her arm to

then, with shuddering intensity, exclaims</i>)

SERGIUS.<br />
Never! (<i>and gets away as far as possible from her.</i>)

RAINA.<br />
I’m ready! What’s the matter? (<i>Gaily.</i>) Have you been

CATHERINE.<br />
(<i>coming down to them</i>). I am sorry to disturb you, children; but Paul is
distracted over those three regiments. He does not know how to get them to

him, Sergius. He is in the library.

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
(<i>disappointed</i>). But we are just going out for a walk.

the door.</i>)

RAINA.<br />
(<i>following him to the foot of the steps and looking up at him with timid
coquetry</i>). I shall go round and wait in full view of the library windows.
Be sure you draw father’s attention to me. If you are a moment longer
than five minutes, I shall go in and fetch you, regiments or no regiments.

SERGIUS.<br />
(<i>laughing</i>). Very well. (<i>He goes in. Raina watches him until he is out

Little beast! What little beast?

To go and tell! Oh, if I had him here, I’d stuff him with chocolate
creams till he couldn’t ever speak again!

Don’t talk nonsense. Tell me the truth, Raina. How long was he in your
room before you came to me?

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
(<i>whisking round and recommencing her march in the opposite direction</i>).
Oh, I forget.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
CATHERINE.<br />
You cannot forget! Did he really climb up after the soldiers were gone, or was
he there when that officer searched the room?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
No. Yes, I think he must have been there then.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
CATHERINE.<br />
You think! Oh, Raina, Raina! Will anything ever make you straightforward? If
Sergius finds out, it is all over between you.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
(<i>with cool impertinence</i>). Oh, I know Sergius is your pet. I sometimes
wish you could marry him instead of me. You would just suit him. You would pet
him, and spoil him, and mother him to perfection.

<p class="dialog">
CATHERINE.<br />
(<i>opening her eyes very widely indeed</i>). Well, upon my word!

RAINA.<br />

say something dreadful to him—to shock his propriety—to scandalize
the five senses out of him! (<i>To Catherine perversely.</i>) I don’t
care whether he finds out about the chocolate cream soldier or not. I half hope
he may. (<i>She again turns flippantly away and strolls up the path to the

And what should I be able to say to your father, pray?

LOUKA.<br />
There’s a gentleman just called, madam—a Servian officer—

CATHERINE.<br />

don’t you tell your master? He is in the library with Major Saranoff. Why
do you come to me?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
LOUKA.<br />
But he asks for you, madam. And I don’t think he knows who you are: he

we’re not at home—ask him to leave his address and I’ll write

LOUKA.<br />
Yes, madam.

Stop! (<i>Louka stops.</i>) He will have to go out that way (<i>indicating the

(<i>surprised</i>). His bag?

CATHERINE.<br />
Yes, here, as soon as possible. (<i>Vehemently.</i>) Be quick! (<i>Louka runs
into the house. Catherine snatches her apron off and throws it behind a bush.

handkerchief tied round her head follows the apron. A touch to her hair and a
shake to her dressing gown makes her presentable.</i>) Oh,
how—how—how can a man be such a fool! Such a moment to select!
(<i>Louka appears at the door of the house, announcing “Captain
Bluntschli;” and standing aside at the top of the steps to let him pass
before she goes in again. He is the man of the adventure in Raina’s room.
He is now clean, well brushed, smartly uniformed, and out of trouble, but still
unmistakably the same man. The moment Louka’s back is turned, Catherine
swoops on him with hurried, urgent, coaxing appeal.</i>) Captain Bluntschli, I
am very glad to see you; but you must leave this house at once. (<i>He raises
his eyebrows.</i>) My husband has just returned, with my future son-in-law; and
they know nothing. If they did, the consequences would be terrible. You are a
foreigner: you do not feel our national animosities as we do. We still hate the
Servians: the only effect of the peace on my husband is to make him feel like a
lion baulked of his prey. If he discovered our secret, he would never forgive
me; and my daughter’s life would hardly be safe. Will you, like the
chivalrous gentleman and soldier you are, leave at once before he finds you
here?

<p class="dialog">
BLUNTSCHLI.<br />
(<i>disappointed, but philosophical</i>). At once, gracious lady. I only came
to thank you and return the coat you lent me. If you will allow me to take it
out of my bag and leave it with your servant as I pass out, I need detain you
no further. (<i>He turns to go into the house.</i>)

CATHERINE.<br />
(<i>catching him by the sleeve</i>). Oh, you must not think of going back that
way. (<i>Coaxing him across to the stable gates.</i>) This is the shortest way
out. Many thanks. So glad to have been of service to you. Good-bye.

BLUNTSCHLI.<br />
But my bag?

<p class="dialog">
CATHERINE.<br />
It will be sent on. You will leave me your address.

BLUNTSCHLI.<br />
True. Allow me. (<i>He takes out his card-case, and stops to write his address,

Oh, quite as a friend, Paul. I was just asking Captain Bluntschli to stay to
lunch; but he declares he must go at once.

BLUNTSCHLI.<br />

NICOLA.<br />
(<i>taken aback</i>). Sir?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
PETKOFF.<br />
What have you brought that for?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
NICOLA.<br />
My lady’s orders, sir. Louka told me that—
</p>

<p class="dialog">
CATHERINE.<br />
(<i>interrupting him</i>). My orders! Why should I order you to bring Captain
Bluntschli’s luggage out here? What are you thinking of, Nicola?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
NICOLA.<br />
(<i>after a moment’s bewilderment, picking up the bag as he addresses
Bluntschli with the very perfection of servile discretion</i>). I beg your
pardon, sir, I am sure. (<i>To Catherine.</i>) My fault, madam! I hope
you’ll overlook it! (<i>He bows, and is going to the steps with the bag,
when Petkoff addresses him angrily.</i>)
</p>

<p class="dialog">
PETKOFF.<br />
You’d better go and slam that bag, too, down on Miss Raina’s ice
pudding! (<i>This is too much for Nicola. The bag drops from his hands on
Petkoff’s corns, eliciting a roar of anguish from him.</i>) Begone, you
butter-fingered donkey.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
NICOLA.<br />
(<i>snatching up the bag, and escaping into the house</i>). Yes, sir.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
CATHERINE.<br />
Oh, never mind, Paul, don’t be angry!
</p>

<p class="dialog">
PETKOFF.<br />
(<i>muttering</i>). Scoundrel. He’s got out of hand while I was away.
I’ll teach him. (<i>Recollecting his guest.</i>) Oh, well, never mind.
Come, Bluntschli, lets have no more nonsense about you having to go away. You
know very well you’re not going back to Switzerland yet. Until you do go
back you’ll stay with us.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
Oh, do, Captain Bluntschli.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
PETKOFF.<br />
(<i>to Catherine</i>). Now, Catherine, it’s of you that he’s
afraid. Press him and he’ll stay.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
CATHERINE.<br />
Of course I shall be only too delighted if (<i>appealingly</i>) Captain
Bluntschli really wishes to stay. He knows my wishes.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BLUNTSCHLI.<br />
(<i>in his driest military manner</i>). I am at madame’s orders.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SERGIUS.<br />
(<i>cordially</i>). That settles it!
</p>

<p class="dialog">
PETKOFF.<br />
(<i>heartily</i>). Of course!
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
You see, you must stay!
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BLUNTSCHLI.<br />
(<i>smiling</i>). Well, If I must, I must! (<i>Gesture of despair from
Catherine.</i>)

<h3><a name="chap05" id="chap05"></a>ACT III</h3>

<p class="stage">
In the library after lunch. It is not much of a library, its literary equipment
consisting of a single fixed shelf stocked with old paper-covered novels,
broken backed, coffee stained, torn and thumbed, and a couple of little hanging
shelves with a few gift books on them, the rest of the wall space being
occupied by trophies of war and the chase. But it is a most comfortable
sitting-room. A row of three large windows in the front of the house shew a
mountain panorama, which is just now seen in one of its softest aspects in the
mellowing afternoon light. In the left hand corner, a square earthenware stove,
a perfect tower of colored pottery, rises nearly to the ceiling and guarantees
plenty of warmth. The ottoman in the middle is a circular bank of decorated
cushions, and the window seats are well upholstered divans. Little Turkish
tables, one of them with an elaborate hookah on it, and a screen to match them,
complete the handsome effect of the furnishing. There is one object, however,
which is hopelessly out of keeping with its surroundings. This is a small
kitchen table, much the worse for wear, fitted as a writing table with an old
canister full of pens, an eggcup filled with ink, and a deplorable scrap of
severely used pink blotting paper.
</p>

<p class="stage">
At the side of this table, which stands on the right, Bluntschli is hard at
work, with a couple of maps before him, writing orders. At the head of it sits
Sergius, who is also supposed to be at work, but who is actually gnawing the
feather of a pen, and contemplating Bluntschli’s quick, sure,
businesslike progress with a mixture of envious irritation at his own
incapacity, and awestruck wonder at an ability which seems to him almost
miraculous, though its prosaic character forbids him to esteem it. The major is
comfortably established on the ottoman, with a newspaper in his hand and the
tube of the hookah within his reach. Catherine sits at the stove, with her back
to them, embroidering. Raina, reclining on the divan under the left hand
window, is gazing in a daydream out at the Balkan landscape, with a neglected
novel in her lap.
</p>

<p class="stage">
The door is on the left. The button of the electric bell is between the door
and the fireplace.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
PETKOFF.<br />
(<i>looking up from his paper to watch how they are getting on at the
table</i>). Are you sure I can’t help you in any way, Bluntschli?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BLUNTSCHLI.<br />
(<i>without interrupting his writing or looking up</i>). Quite sure, thank you.
Saranoff and I will manage it.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SERGIUS.<br />
(<i>grimly</i>). Yes: we’ll manage it. He finds out what to do; draws up
the orders; and I sign ’em. Division of labour, Major. (<i>Bluntschli
passes him a paper.</i>) Another one? Thank you. (<i>He plants the papers
squarely before him; sets his chair carefully parallel to them; and signs with
the air of a man resolutely performing a difficult and dangerous feat.</i>)
This hand is more accustomed to the sword than to the pen.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
PETKOFF.<br />
It’s very good of you, Bluntschli, it is indeed, to let yourself be put
upon in this way. Now are you quite sure I can do nothing?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
CATHERINE.<br />
(<i>in a low, warning tone</i>). You can stop interrupting, Paul.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
PETKOFF.<br />
(<i>starting and looking round at her</i>). Eh? Oh! Quite right, my love, quite
right. (<i>He takes his newspaper up, but lets it drop again.</i>) Ah, you
haven’t been campaigning, Catherine: you don’t know how pleasant it
is for us to sit here, after a good lunch, with nothing to do but enjoy
ourselves. There’s only one thing I want to make me thoroughly
comfortable.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
CATHERINE.<br />
What is that?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
PETKOFF.<br />
My old coat. I’m not at home in this one: I feel as if I were on parade.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
CATHERINE.<br />
My dear Paul, how absurd you are about that old coat! It must be hanging in the
blue closet where you left it.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
PETKOFF.<br />
My dear Catherine, I tell you I’ve looked there. Am I to believe my own
eyes or not? (<i>Catherine quietly rises and presses the button of the electric
bell by the fireplace.</i>) What are you shewing off that bell for? (<i>She
looks at him majestically, and silently resumes her chair and her
needlework.</i>) My dear: if you think the obstinacy of your sex can make a
coat out of two old dressing gowns of Raina’s, your waterproof, and my
mackintosh, you’re mistaken. That’s exactly what the blue closet
contains at present. (<i>Nicola presents himself.</i>)
</p>

<p class="dialog">
CATHERINE.<br />
(<i>unmoved by Petkoff’s sally</i>). Nicola: go to the blue closet and
bring your master’s old coat here—the braided one he usually wears
in the house.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
NICOLA.<br />
Yes, madam. (<i>Nicola goes out.</i>)
</p>

<p class="dialog">
PETKOFF.<br />
Catherine.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
CATHERINE.<br />
Yes, Paul?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
PETKOFF.<br />
I bet you any piece of jewellery you like to order from Sofia against a
week’s housekeeping money, that the coat isn’t there.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
CATHERINE.<br />
Done, Paul.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
PETKOFF.<br />
(<i>excited by the prospect of a gamble</i>). Come: here’s an opportunity
for some sport. Who’ll bet on it? Bluntschli: I’ll give you six to
one.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BLUNTSCHLI.<br />
(<i>imperturbably</i>). It would be robbing you, Major. Madame is sure to be
right. (<i>Without looking up, he passes another batch of papers to
Sergius.</i>)
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SERGIUS.<br />
(<i>also excited</i>). Bravo, Switzerland! Major: I bet my best charger against
an Arab mare for Raina that Nicola finds the coat in the blue closet.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
PETKOFF.<br />
(<i>eagerly</i>). Your best char—
</p>

<p class="dialog">
CATHERINE.<br />
(<i>hastily interrupting him</i>). Don’t be foolish, Paul. An Arabian
mare will cost you 50,000 levas.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
(<i>suddenly coming out of her picturesque revery</i>). Really, mother, if you
are going to take the jewellery, I don’t see why you should grudge me my
Arab.
</p>

<p class="stage">
(<i>Nicola comes back with the coat and brings it to Petkoff, who can hardly
believe his eyes.</i>)
</p>

<p class="dialog">
CATHERINE.<br />
Where was it, Nicola?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
NICOLA.<br />
Hanging in the blue closet, madam.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
PETKOFF.<br />
Well, I am d—
</p>

<p class="dialog">
CATHERINE.<br />
(<i>stopping him</i>). Paul!
</p>

<p class="dialog">
PETKOFF.<br />
I could have sworn it wasn’t there. Age is beginning to tell on me.
I’m getting hallucinations. (<i>To Nicola.</i>) Here: help me to change.
Excuse me, Bluntschli. (<i>He begins changing coats, Nicola acting as
valet.</i>) Remember: I didn’t take that bet of yours, Sergius.
You’d better give Raina that Arab steed yourself, since you’ve
roused her expectations. Eh, Raina? (<i>He looks round at her; but she is again
rapt in the landscape. With a little gush of paternal affection and pride, he
points her out to them and says</i>) She’s dreaming, as usual.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SERGIUS.<br />
Assuredly she shall not be the loser.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
PETKOFF.<br />
So much the better for her. I shan’t come off so cheap, I expect. (<i>The
change is now complete. Nicola goes out with the discarded coat.</i>) Ah, now I
feel at home at last. (<i>He sits down and takes his newspaper with a grunt of
relief.</i>)
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BLUNTSCHLI.<br />
(<i>to Sergius, handing a paper</i>). That’s the last order.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
PETKOFF.<br />
(<i>jumping up</i>). What! finished?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BLUNTSCHLI.<br />
Finished. (<i>Petkoff goes beside Sergius; looks curiously over his left
shoulder as he signs; and says with childlike envy</i>) Haven’t you
anything for me to sign?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BLUNTSCHLI.<br />
Not necessary. His signature will do.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
PETKOFF.<br />
Ah, well, I think we’ve done a thundering good day’s work. (<i>He
goes away from the table.</i>) Can I do anything more?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BLUNTSCHLI.<br />
You had better both see the fellows that are to take these. (<i>To
Sergius.</i>) Pack them off at once; and shew them that I’ve marked on
the orders the time they should hand them in by. Tell them that if they stop to
drink or tell stories—if they’re five minutes late, they’ll
have the skin taken off their backs.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SERGIUS.<br />
(<i>rising indignantly</i>). I’ll say so. And if one of them is man
enough to spit in my face for insulting him, I’ll buy his discharge and
give him a pension. (<i>He strides out, his humanity deeply outraged.</i>)
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BLUNTSCHLI.<br />
(<i>confidentially</i>). Just see that he talks to them properly, Major, will
you?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
PETKOFF.<br />
(<i>officiously</i>). Quite right, Bluntschli, quite right. I’ll see to
it. (<i>He goes to the door importantly, but hesitates on the threshold.</i>)
By the bye, Catherine, you may as well come, too. They’ll be far more
frightened of you than of me.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
CATHERINE.<br />
(<i>putting down her embroidery</i>). I daresay I had better. You will only
splutter at them. (<i>She goes out, Petkoff holding the door for her and
following her.</i>)
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BLUNTSCHLI.<br />
What a country! They make cannons out of cherry trees; and the officers send
for their wives to keep discipline! (<i>He begins to fold and docket the
papers. Raina, who has risen from the divan, strolls down the room with her
hands clasped behind her, and looks mischievously at him.</i>)
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
You look ever so much nicer than when we last met. (<i>He looks up,
surprised.</i>) What have you done to yourself?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BLUNTSCHLI.<br />
Washed; brushed; good night’s sleep and breakfast. That’s all.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
Did you get back safely that morning?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BLUNTSCHLI.<br />
Quite, thanks.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
Were they angry with you for running away from Sergius’s charge?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BLUNTSCHLI.<br />
No, they were glad; because they’d all just run away themselves.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
(<i>going to the table, and leaning over it towards him</i>). It must have made
a lovely story for them—all that about me and my room.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BLUNTSCHLI.<br />
Capital story. But I only told it to one of them—a particular friend.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
On whose discretion you could absolutely rely?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BLUNTSCHLI.<br />
Absolutely.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
Hm! He told it all to my father and Sergius the day you exchanged the
prisoners. (<i>She turns away and strolls carelessly across to the other side
of the room.</i>)
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BLUNTSCHLI.<br />
(<i>deeply concerned and half incredulous</i>). No! you don’t mean that,
do you?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
(<i>turning, with sudden earnestness</i>). I do indeed. But they don’t
know that it was in this house that you hid. If Sergius knew, he would
challenge you and kill you in a duel.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BLUNTSCHLI.<br />
Bless me! then don’t tell him.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
(<i>full of reproach for his levity</i>). Can you realize what it is to me to
deceive him? I want to be quite perfect with Sergius—no meanness, no
smallness, no deceit. My relation to him is the one really beautiful and noble
part of my life. I hope you can understand that.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BLUNTSCHLI.<br />
(<i>sceptically</i>). You mean that you wouldn’t like him to find out
that the story about the ice pudding was a—a—a—You know.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
(<i>wincing</i>). Ah, don’t talk of it in that flippant way. I lied: I
know it. But I did it to save your life. He would have killed you. That was the
second time I ever uttered a falsehood. (<i>Bluntschli rises quickly and looks
doubtfully and somewhat severely at her.</i>) Do you remember the first time?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BLUNTSCHLI.<br />
I! No. Was I present?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
Yes; and I told the officer who was searching for you that you were not
present.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BLUNTSCHLI.<br />
True. I should have remembered it.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
(<i>greatly encouraged</i>). Ah, it is natural that you should forget it first.
It cost you nothing: it cost me a lie!—a lie!! (<i>She sits down on the
ottoman, looking straight before her with her hands clasped on her knee.
Bluntschli, quite touched, goes to the ottoman with a particularly reassuring
and considerate air, and sits down beside her.</i>)
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BLUNTSCHLI.<br />
My dear young lady, don’t let this worry you. Remember: I’m a
soldier. Now what are the two things that happen to a soldier so often that he
comes to think nothing of them? One is hearing people tell lies (<i>Raina
recoils</i>): the other is getting his life saved in all sorts of ways by all
sorts of people.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
(<i>rising in indignant protest</i>). And so he becomes a creature incapable of
faith and of gratitude.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BLUNTSCHLI.<br />
(<i>making a wry face</i>). Do you like gratitude? I don’t. If pity is
akin to love, gratitude is akin to the other thing.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
Gratitude! (<i>Turning on him.</i>) If you are incapable of gratitude you are
incapable of any noble sentiment. Even animals are grateful. Oh, I see now
exactly what you think of me! You were not surprised to hear me lie. To you it
was something I probably did every day—every hour. That is how men think
of women. (<i>She walks up the room melodramatically.</i>)
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BLUNTSCHLI.<br />
(<i>dubiously</i>). There’s reason in everything. You said you’d
told only two lies in your whole life. Dear young lady: isn’t that rather
a short allowance? I’m quite a straightforward man myself; but it
wouldn’t last me a whole morning.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
(<i>staring haughtily at him</i>). Do you know, sir, that you are insulting me?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BLUNTSCHLI.<br />
I can’t help it. When you get into that noble attitude and speak in that
thrilling voice, I admire you; but I find it impossible to believe a single
word you say.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
(<i>superbly</i>). Captain Bluntschli!
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BLUNTSCHLI.<br />
(<i>unmoved</i>). Yes?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
(<i>coming a little towards him, as if she could not believe her senses</i>).
Do you mean what you said just now? Do you know what you said just now?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BLUNTSCHLI.<br />
I do.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
(<i>gasping</i>). I! I!!! (<i>She points to herself incredulously, meaning
“I, Raina Petkoff, tell lies!” He meets her gaze unflinchingly. She
suddenly sits down beside him, and adds, with a complete change of manner from
the heroic to the familiar</i>) How did you find me out?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BLUNTSCHLI.<br />
(<i>promptly</i>). Instinct, dear young lady. Instinct, and experience of the
world.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
(<i>wonderingly</i>). Do you know, you are the first man I ever met who did not
take me seriously?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BLUNTSCHLI.<br />
You mean, don’t you, that I am the first man that has ever taken you
quite seriously?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
Yes, I suppose I do mean that. (<i>Cosily, quite at her ease with him.</i>) How
strange it is to be talked to in such a way! You know, I’ve always gone
on like that—I mean the noble attitude and the thrilling voice. I did it
when I was a tiny child to my nurse. She believed in it. I do it before my
parents. They believe in it. I do it before Sergius. He believes in it.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BLUNTSCHLI.<br />
Yes: he’s a little in that line himself, isn’t he?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
(<i>startled</i>). Do you think so?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BLUNTSCHLI.<br />
You know him better than I do.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
I wonder—I wonder is he? If I thought that—! (<i>Discouraged.</i>)
Ah, well, what does it matter? I suppose, now that you’ve found me out,
you despise me.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BLUNTSCHLI.<br />
(<i>warmly, rising</i>). No, my dear young lady, no, no, no a thousand times.
It’s part of your youth—part of your charm. I’m like all the
rest of them—the nurse—your parents—Sergius: I’m your
infatuated admirer.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
(<i>pleased</i>). Really?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BLUNTSCHLI.<br />
(<i>slapping his breast smartly with his hand, German fashion</i>). Hand aufs
Herz! Really and truly.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
(<i>very happy</i>). But what did you think of me for giving you my portrait?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BLUNTSCHLI.<br />
(<i>astonished</i>). Your portrait! You never gave me your portrait.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
(<i>quickly</i>). Do you mean to say you never got it?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BLUNTSCHLI.<br />
No. (<i>He sits down beside her, with renewed interest, and says, with some
complacency.</i>) When did you send it to me?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
(<i>indignantly</i>). I did not send it to you. (<i>She turns her head away,
and adds, reluctantly.</i>) It was in the pocket of that coat.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BLUNTSCHLI.<br />
(<i>pursing his lips and rounding his eyes</i>). Oh-o-oh! I never found it. It
must be there still.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
(<i>springing up</i>). There still!—for my father to find the first time
he puts his hand in his pocket! Oh, how could you be so stupid?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BLUNTSCHLI.<br />
(<i>rising also</i>). It doesn’t matter: it’s only a photograph:
how can he tell who it was intended for? Tell him he put it there himself.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
(<i>impatiently</i>). Yes, that is so clever—so clever! What shall I do?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BLUNTSCHLI.<br />
Ah, I see. You wrote something on it. That was rash!
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
(<i>annoyed almost to tears</i>). Oh, to have done such a thing for you, who
care no more—except to laugh at me—oh! Are you sure nobody has
touched it?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BLUNTSCHLI.<br />
Well, I can’t be quite sure. You see I couldn’t carry it about with
me all the time: one can’t take much luggage on active service.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
What did you do with it?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BLUNTSCHLI.<br />
When I got through to Peerot I had to put it in safe keeping somehow. I thought
of the railway cloak room; but that’s the surest place to get looted in
modern warfare. So I pawned it.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
Pawned it!!!
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BLUNTSCHLI.<br />
I know it doesn’t sound nice; but it was much the safest plan. I redeemed
it the day before yesterday. Heaven only knows whether the pawnbroker cleared
out the pockets or not.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
(<i>furious—throwing the words right into his face</i>). You have a low,
shopkeeping mind. You think of things that would never come into a
gentleman’s head.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BLUNTSCHLI.<br />
(<i>phlegmatically</i>). That’s the Swiss national character, dear lady.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
Oh, I wish I had never met you. (<i>She flounces away and sits at the window
fuming.</i>)
</p>

<p class="stage">
(<i>Louka comes in with a heap of letters and telegrams on her salver, and
crosses, with her bold, free gait, to the table. Her left sleeve is looped up
to the shoulder with a brooch, shewing her naked arm, with a broad gilt
bracelet covering the bruise.</i>)
</p>

<p class="dialog">
LOUKA.<br />
(<i>to Bluntschli</i>). For you. (<i>She empties the salver recklessly on the
table.</i>) The messenger is waiting. (<i>She is determined not to be civil to
a Servian, even if she must bring him his letters.</i>)
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BLUNTSCHLI.<br />
(<i>to Raina</i>). Will you excuse me: the last postal delivery that reached me
was three weeks ago. These are the subsequent accumulations. Four
telegrams—a week old. (<i>He opens one.</i>) Oho! Bad news!
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
(<i>rising and advancing a little remorsefully</i>). Bad news?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BLUNTSCHLI.<br />
My father’s dead. (<i>He looks at the telegram with his lips pursed,
musing on the unexpected change in his arrangements.</i>)
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
Oh, how very sad!
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BLUNTSCHLI.<br />
Yes: I shall have to start for home in an hour. He has left a lot of big hotels
behind him to be looked after. (<i>Takes up a heavy letter in a long blue
envelope.</i>) Here’s a whacking letter from the family solicitor. (<i>He
pulls out the enclosures and glances over them.</i>) Great Heavens! Seventy!
Two hundred! (<i>In a crescendo of dismay.</i>) Four hundred! Four thousand!!
Nine thousand six hundred!!! What on earth shall I do with them all?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
(<i>timidly</i>). Nine thousand hotels?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BLUNTSCHLI.<br />
Hotels! Nonsense. If you only knew!—oh, it’s too ridiculous! Excuse
me: I must give my fellow orders about starting. (<i>He leaves the room
hastily, with the documents in his hand.</i>)
</p>

<p class="dialog">
LOUKA.<br />
(<i>tauntingly</i>). He has not much heart, that Swiss, though he is so fond of
the Servians. He has not a word of grief for his poor father.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
(<i>bitterly</i>). Grief!—a man who has been doing nothing but killing
people for years! What does he care? What does any soldier care? (<i>She goes
to the door, evidently restraining her tears with difficulty.</i>)
</p>

<p class="dialog">
LOUKA.<br />
Major Saranoff has been fighting, too; and he has plenty of heart left.
(<i>Raina, at the door, looks haughtily at her and goes out.</i>) Aha! I
thought you wouldn’t get much feeling out of your soldier. (<i>She is
following Raina when Nicola enters with an armful of logs for the fire.</i>)
</p>

<p class="dialog">
NICOLA.<br />
(<i>grinning amorously at her</i>). I’ve been trying all the afternoon to
get a minute alone with you, my girl. (<i>His countenance changes as he notices
her arm.</i>) Why, what fashion is that of wearing your sleeve, child?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
LOUKA.<br />
(<i>proudly</i>). My own fashion.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
NICOLA.<br />
Indeed! If the mistress catches you, she’ll talk to you. (<i>He throws
the logs down on the ottoman, and sits comfortably beside them.</i>)
</p>

<p class="dialog">
LOUKA.<br />
Is that any reason why you should take it on yourself to talk to me?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
NICOLA.<br />
Come: don’t be so contrary with me. I’ve some good news for you.
(<i>He takes out some paper money. Louka, with an eager gleam in her eyes,
comes close to look at it.</i>) See, a twenty leva bill! Sergius gave me that
out of pure swagger. A fool and his money are soon parted. There’s ten
levas more. The Swiss gave me that for backing up the mistress’s and
Raina’s lies about him. He’s no fool, he isn’t. You should
have heard old Catherine downstairs as polite as you please to me, telling me
not to mind the Major being a little impatient; for they knew what a good
servant I was—after making a fool and a liar of me before them all! The
twenty will go to our savings; and you shall have the ten to spend if
you’ll only talk to me so as to remind me I’m a human being. I get
tired of being a servant occasionally.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
LOUKA.<br />
(<i>scornfully</i>). Yes: sell your manhood for thirty levas, and buy me for
ten! Keep your money. You were born to be a servant. I was not. When you set up
your shop you will only be everybody’s servant instead of
somebody’s servant.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
NICOLA.<br />
(<i>picking up his logs, and going to the stove</i>). Ah, wait till you see. We
shall have our evenings to ourselves; and I shall be master in my own house, I
promise you. (<i>He throws the logs down and kneels at the stove.</i>)
</p>

<p class="dialog">
LOUKA.<br />
You shall never be master in mine. (<i>She sits down on Sergius’s
chair.</i>)
</p>

<p class="dialog">
NICOLA.<br />
(<i>turning, still on his knees, and squatting down rather forlornly, on his
calves, daunted by her implacable disdain</i>). You have a great ambition in
you, Louka. Remember: if any luck comes to you, it was I that made a woman of
you.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
LOUKA.<br />
You!
</p>

<p class="dialog">
NICOLA.<br />
(<i>with dogged self-assertion</i>). Yes, me. Who was it made you give up
wearing a couple of pounds of false black hair on your head and reddening your
lips and cheeks like any other Bulgarian girl? I did. Who taught you to trim
your nails, and keep your hands clean, and be dainty about yourself, like a
fine Russian lady? Me! do you hear that? me! (<i>She tosses her head defiantly;
and he rises, ill-humoredly, adding more coolly</i>) I’ve often thought
that if Raina were out of the way, and you just a little less of a fool and
Sergius just a little more of one, you might come to be one of my grandest
customers, instead of only being my wife and costing me money.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
LOUKA.<br />
I believe you would rather be my servant than my husband. You would make more
out of me. Oh, I know that soul of yours.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
NICOLA.<br />
(<i>going up close to her for greater emphasis</i>). Never you mind my soul;
but just listen to my advice. If you want to be a lady, your present behaviour
to me won’t do at all, unless when we’re alone. It’s too
sharp and impudent; and impudence is a sort of familiarity: it shews affection
for me. And don’t you try being high and mighty with me either.
You’re like all country girls: you think it’s genteel to treat a
servant the way I treat a stable-boy. That’s only your ignorance; and
don’t you forget it. And don’t be so ready to defy everybody. Act
as if you expected to have your own way, not as if you expected to be ordered
about. The way to get on as a lady is the same as the way to get on as a
servant: you’ve got to know your place; that’s the secret of it.
And you may depend on me to know my place if you get promoted. Think over it,
my girl. I’ll stand by you: one servant should always stand by another.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
LOUKA.<br />
(<i>rising impatiently</i>). Oh, I must behave in my own way. You take all the
courage out of me with your cold-blooded wisdom. Go and put those logs on the
fire: that’s the sort of thing you understand. (<i>Before Nicola can
retort, Sergius comes in. He checks himself a moment on seeing Louka; then goes
to the stove.</i>)
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SERGIUS.<br />
(<i>to Nicola</i>). I am not in the way of your work, I hope.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
NICOLA.<br />
(<i>in a smooth, elderly manner</i>). Oh, no, sir, thank you kindly. I was only
speaking to this foolish girl about her habit of running up here to the library
whenever she gets a chance, to look at the books. That’s the worst of her
education, sir: it gives her habits above her station. (<i>To Louka.</i>) Make
that table tidy, Louka, for the Major. (<i>He goes out sedately.</i>)
</p>

<p class="stage">
(<i>Louka, without looking at Sergius, begins to arrange the papers on the
table. He crosses slowly to her, and studies the arrangement of her sleeve
reflectively.</i>)
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SERGIUS.<br />
Let me see: is there a mark there? (<i>He turns up the bracelet and sees the
bruise made by his grasp. She stands motionless, not looking at him:
fascinated, but on her guard.</i>) Ffff! Does it hurt?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
LOUKA.<br />
Yes.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SERGIUS.<br />
Shall I cure it?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
LOUKA.<br />
(<i>instantly withdrawing herself proudly, but still not looking at him</i>).
No. You cannot cure it now.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SERGIUS.<br />
(<i>masterfully</i>). Quite sure? (<i>He makes a movement as if to take her in
his arms.</i>)
</p>

<p class="dialog">
LOUKA.<br />
Don’t trifle with me, please. An officer should not trifle with a
servant.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SERGIUS.<br />
(<i>touching the arm with a merciless stroke of his forefinger</i>). That was
no trifle, Louka.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
LOUKA.<br />
No. (<i>Looking at him for the first time.</i>) Are you sorry?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SERGIUS.<br />
(<i>with measured emphasis, folding his arms</i>). I am never sorry.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
LOUKA.<br />
(<i>wistfully</i>). I wish I could believe a man could be so unlike a woman as
that. I wonder are you really a brave man?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SERGIUS.<br />
(<i>unaffectedly, relaxing his attitude</i>). Yes: I am a brave man. My heart
jumped like a woman’s at the first shot; but in the charge I found that I
was brave. Yes: that at least is real about me.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
LOUKA.<br />
Did you find in the charge that the men whose fathers are poor like mine were
any less brave than the men who are rich like you?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SERGIUS.<br />
(<i>with bitter levity.</i>) Not a bit. They all slashed and cursed and yelled
like heroes. Psha! the courage to rage and kill is cheap. I have an English
bull terrier who has as much of that sort of courage as the whole Bulgarian
nation, and the whole Russian nation at its back. But he lets my groom thrash
him, all the same. That’s your soldier all over! No, Louka, your poor men
can cut throats; but they are afraid of their officers; they put up with
insults and blows; they stand by and see one another punished like
children—-aye, and help to do it when they are ordered. And the
officers!—-well (<i>with a short, bitter laugh</i>) I am an officer. Oh,
(<i>fervently</i>) give me the man who will defy to the death any power on
earth or in heaven that sets itself up against his own will and conscience: he
alone is the brave man.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
LOUKA.<br />
How easy it is to talk! Men never seem to me to grow up: they all have
schoolboy’s ideas. You don’t know what true courage is.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SERGIUS.<br />
(<i>ironically</i>). Indeed! I am willing to be instructed.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
LOUKA.<br />
Look at me! how much am I allowed to have my own will? I have to get your room
ready for you—to sweep and dust, to fetch and carry. How could that
degrade me if it did not degrade you to have it done for you? But (<i>with
subdued passion</i>) if I were Empress of Russia, above everyone in the world,
then—ah, then, though according to you I could shew no courage at all;
you should see, you should see.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SERGIUS.<br />
What would you do, most noble Empress?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
LOUKA.<br />
I would marry the man I loved, which no other queen in Europe has the courage
to do. If I loved you, though you would be as far beneath me as I am beneath
you, I would dare to be the equal of my inferior. Would you dare as much if you
loved me? No: if you felt the beginnings of love for me you would not let it
grow. You dare not: you would marry a rich man’s daughter because you
would be afraid of what other people would say of you.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SERGIUS.<br />
(<i>carried away</i>). You lie: it is not so, by all the stars! If I loved you,
and I were the Czar himself, I would set you on the throne by my side. You know
that I love another woman, a woman as high above you as heaven is above earth.
And you are jealous of her.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
LOUKA.<br />
I have no reason to be. She will never marry you now. The man I told you of has
come back. She will marry the Swiss.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SERGIUS.<br />
(<i>recoiling</i>). The Swiss!
</p>

<p class="dialog">
LOUKA.<br />
A man worth ten of you. Then you can come to me; and I will refuse you. You are
not good enough for me. (<i>She turns to the door.</i>)
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SERGIUS.<br />
(<i>springing after her and catching her fiercely in his arms</i>). I will kill
the Swiss; and afterwards I will do as I please with you.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
LOUKA.<br />
(<i>in his arms, passive and steadfast</i>). The Swiss will kill you, perhaps.
He has beaten you in love. He may beat you in war.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SERGIUS.<br />
(<i>tormentedly</i>). Do you think I believe that she—she! whose worst
thoughts are higher than your best ones, is capable of trifling with another
man behind my back?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
LOUKA.<br />
Do you think she would believe the Swiss if he told her now that I am in your
arms?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SERGIUS.<br />
(<i>releasing her in despair</i>). Damnation! Oh, damnation! Mockery, mockery
everywhere: everything I think is mocked by everything I do. (<i>He strikes
himself frantically on the breast.</i>) Coward, liar, fool! Shall I kill myself
like a man, or live and pretend to laugh at myself? (<i>She again turns to
go.</i>) Louka! (<i>She stops near the door.</i>) Remember: you belong to me.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
LOUKA.<br />
(<i>quietly</i>). What does that mean—an insult?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SERGIUS.<br />
(<i>commandingly</i>). It means that you love me, and that I have had you here
in my arms, and will perhaps have you there again. Whether that is an insult I
neither know nor care: take it as you please. But (<i>vehemently</i>) I will
not be a coward and a trifler. If I choose to love you, I dare marry you, in
spite of all Bulgaria. If these hands ever touch you again, they shall touch my
affianced bride.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
LOUKA.<br />
We shall see whether you dare keep your word. But take care. I will not wait
long.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SERGIUS.<br />
(<i>again folding his arms and standing motionless in the middle of the
room</i>). Yes, we shall see. And you shall wait my pleasure.
</p>

<p class="stage">
(<i>Bluntschli, much preoccupied, with his papers still in his hand, enters,
leaving the door open for Louka to go out. He goes across to the table,
glancing at her as he passes. Sergius, without altering his resolute attitude,
watches him steadily. Louka goes out, leaving the door open.</i>)
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BLUNTSCHLI.<br />
(<i>absently, sitting at the table as before, and putting down his papers</i>).
That’s a remarkable looking young woman.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SERGIUS.<br />
(<i>gravely, without moving</i>). Captain Bluntschli.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BLUNTSCHLI.<br />
Eh?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SERGIUS.<br />
You have deceived me. You are my rival. I brook no rivals. At six o’clock
I shall be in the drilling-ground on the Klissoura road, alone, on horseback,
with my sabre. Do you understand?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BLUNTSCHLI.<br />
(<i>staring, but sitting quite at his ease</i>). Oh, thank you: that’s a
cavalry man’s proposal. I’m in the artillery; and I have the choice
of weapons. If I go, I shall take a machine gun. And there shall be no mistake
about the cartridges this time.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SERGIUS.<br />
(<i>flushing, but with deadly coldness</i>). Take care, sir. It is not our
custom in Bulgaria to allow invitations of that kind to be trifled with.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BLUNTSCHLI.<br />
(<i>warmly</i>). Pooh! don’t talk to me about Bulgaria. You don’t
know what fighting is. But have it your own way. Bring your sabre along.
I’ll meet you.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SERGIUS.<br />
(<i>fiercely delighted to find his opponent a man of spirit</i>). Well said,
Switzer. Shall I lend you my best horse?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BLUNTSCHLI.<br />
No: damn your horse!—-thank you all the same, my dear fellow. (<i>Raina
comes in, and hears the next sentence.</i>) I shall fight you on foot.
Horseback’s too dangerous: I don’t want to kill you if I can help
it.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
(<i>hurrying forward anxiously</i>). I have heard what Captain Bluntschli said,
Sergius. You are going to fight. Why? (<i>Sergius turns away in silence, and
goes to the stove, where he stands watching her as she continues, to
Bluntschli</i>) What about?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BLUNTSCHLI.<br />
I don’t know: he hasn’t told me. Better not interfere, dear young
lady. No harm will be done: I’ve often acted as sword instructor. He
won’t be able to touch me; and I’ll not hurt him. It will save
explanations. In the morning I shall be off home; and you’ll never see me
or hear of me again. You and he will then make it up and live happily ever
after.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
(<i>turning away deeply hurt, almost with a sob in her voice</i>). I never said
I wanted to see you again.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SERGIUS.<br />
(<i>striding forward</i>). Ha! That is a confession.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
(<i>haughtily</i>). What do you mean?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SERGIUS.<br />
You love that man!
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
(<i>scandalized</i>). Sergius!
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SERGIUS.<br />
You allow him to make love to you behind my back, just as you accept me as your
affianced husband behind his. Bluntschli: you knew our relations; and you
deceived me. It is for that that I call you to account, not for having received
favours that I never enjoyed.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BLUNTSCHLI.<br />
(<i>jumping up indignantly</i>). Stuff! Rubbish! I have received no favours.
Why, the young lady doesn’t even know whether I’m married or not.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
(<i>forgetting herself</i>). Oh! (<i>Collapsing on the ottoman.</i>) Are you?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SERGIUS.<br />
You see the young lady’s concern, Captain Bluntschli. Denial is useless.
You have enjoyed the privilege of being received in her own room, late at
night—
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BLUNTSCHLI.<br />
(<i>interrupting him pepperily</i>). Yes; you blockhead! She received me with a
pistol at her head. Your cavalry were at my heels. I’d have blown out her
brains if she’d uttered a cry.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SERGIUS.<br />
(<i>taken aback</i>). Bluntschli! Raina: is this true?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
(<i>rising in wrathful majesty</i>). Oh, how dare you, how dare you?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BLUNTSCHLI.<br />
Apologize, man, apologize! (<i>He resumes his seat at the table.</i>)
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SERGIUS.<br />
(<i>with the old measured emphasis, folding his arms</i>). I never apologize.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
(<i>passionately</i>). This is the doing of that friend of yours, Captain
Bluntschli. It is he who is spreading this horrible story about me. (<i>She
walks about excitedly.</i>)
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BLUNTSCHLI.<br />
No: he’s dead—burnt alive.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
(<i>stopping, shocked</i>). Burnt alive!
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BLUNTSCHLI.<br />
Shot in the hip in a wood yard. Couldn’t drag himself out. Your
fellows’ shells set the timber on fire and burnt him, with half a dozen
other poor devils in the same predicament.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
How horrible!
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SERGIUS.<br />
And how ridiculous! Oh, war! war! the dream of patriots and heroes! A fraud,
Bluntschli, a hollow sham, like love.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
(<i>outraged</i>). Like love! You say that before me.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BLUNTSCHLI.<br />
Come, Saranoff: that matter is explained.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SERGIUS.<br />
A hollow sham, I say. Would you have come back here if nothing had passed
between you, except at the muzzle of your pistol? Raina is mistaken about our
friend who was burnt. He was not my informant.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
Who then? (<i>Suddenly guessing the truth.</i>) Ah, Louka! my maid, my servant!
You were with her this morning all that time after—-after—-Oh, what
sort of god is this I have been worshipping! (<i>He meets her gaze with
sardonic enjoyment of her disenchantment. Angered all the more, she goes closer
to him, and says, in a lower, intenser tone</i>) Do you know that I looked out
of the window as I went upstairs, to have another sight of my hero; and I saw
something that I did not understand then. I know now that you were making love
to her.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SERGIUS.<br />
(<i>with grim humor</i>). You saw that?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
Only too well. (<i>She turns away, and throws herself on the divan under the
centre window, quite overcome.</i>)
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SERGIUS.<br />
(<i>cynically</i>). Raina: our romance is shattered. Life’s a farce.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BLUNTSCHLI.<br />
(<i>to Raina, goodhumoredly</i>). You see: he’s found himself out now.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SERGIUS.<br />
Bluntschli: I have allowed you to call me a blockhead. You may now call me a
coward as well. I refuse to fight you. Do you know why?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BLUNTSCHLI.<br />
No; but it doesn’t matter. I didn’t ask the reason when you cried
on; and I don’t ask the reason now that you cry off. I’m a
professional soldier. I fight when I have to, and am very glad to get out of it
when I haven’t to. You’re only an amateur: you think
fighting’s an amusement.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SERGIUS.<br />
You shall hear the reason all the same, my professional. The reason is that it
takes two men—real men—men of heart, blood and honor—to make
a genuine combat. I could no more fight with you than I could make love to an
ugly woman. You’ve no magnetism: you’re not a man, you’re a
machine.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BLUNTSCHLI.<br />
(<i>apologetically</i>). Quite true, quite true. I always was that sort of
chap. I’m very sorry. But now that you’ve found that life
isn’t a farce, but something quite sensible and serious, what further
obstacle is there to your happiness?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
(<i>riling</i>). You are very solicitous about my happiness and his. Do you
forget his new love—Louka? It is not you that he must fight now, but his
rival, Nicola.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SERGIUS.<br />
Rival!! (<i>Striking his forehead.</i>)
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
Did you not know that they are engaged?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SERGIUS.<br />
Nicola! Are fresh abysses opening! Nicola!!
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
(<i>sarcastically</i>). A shocking sacrifice, isn’t it? Such beauty, such
intellect, such modesty, wasted on a middle-aged servant man! Really, Sergius,
you cannot stand by and allow such a thing. It would be unworthy of your
chivalry.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SERGIUS.<br />
(<i>losing all self-control</i>). Viper! Viper! (<i>He rushes to and fro,
raging.</i>)
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BLUNTSCHLI.<br />
Look here, Saranoff; you’re getting the worst of this.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
(<i>getting angrier</i>). Do you realize what he has done, Captain Bluntschli?
He has set this girl as a spy on us; and her reward is that he makes love to
her.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SERGIUS.<br />
False! Monstrous!
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
Monstrous! (<i>Confronting him.</i>) Do you deny that she told you about
Captain Bluntschli being in my room?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SERGIUS.<br />
No; but—
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
(<i>interrupting</i>). Do you deny that you were making love to her when she
told you?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SERGIUS.<br />
No; but I tell you—
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
(<i>cutting him short contemptuously</i>). It is unnecessary to tell us
anything more. That is quite enough for us. (<i>She turns her back on him and
sweeps majestically back to the window.</i>)
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BLUNTSCHLI.<br />
(<i>quietly, as Sergius, in an agony of mortification, sinks on the ottoman,
clutching his averted head between his fists</i>). I told you you were getting
the worst of it, Saranoff.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SERGIUS.<br />
Tiger cat!
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
(<i>running excitedly to Bluntschli</i>). You hear this man calling me names,
Captain Bluntschli?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BLUNTSCHLI.<br />
What else can he do, dear lady? He must defend himself somehow. Come (<i>very
persuasively</i>), don’t quarrel. What good does it do? (<i>Raina, with a
gasp, sits down on the ottoman, and after a vain effort to look vexedly at
Bluntschli, she falls a victim to her sense of humor, and is attacked with a
disposition to laugh.</i>)
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SERGIUS.<br />
Engaged to Nicola! (<i>He rises.</i>) Ha! ha! (<i>Going to the stove and
standing with his back to it.</i>) Ah, well, Bluntschli, you are right to take
this huge imposture of a world coolly.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
(<i>to Bluntschli with an intuitive guess at his state of mind</i>). I daresay
you think us a couple of grown up babies, don’t you?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SERGIUS.<br />
(<i>grinning a little</i>). He does, he does. Swiss civilization nursetending
Bulgarian barbarism, eh?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BLUNTSCHLI.<br />
(<i>blushing</i>). Not at all, I assure you. I’m only very glad to get
you two quieted. There now, let’s be pleasant and talk it over in a
friendly way. Where is this other young lady?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
Listening at the door, probably.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SERGIUS.<br />
(<i>shivering as if a bullet had struck him, and speaking with quiet but deep
indignation</i>). I will prove that that, at least, is a calumny. (<i>He goes
with dignity to the door and opens it. A yell of fury bursts from him as he
looks out. He darts into the passage, and returns dragging in Louka, whom he
flings against the table, R., as he cries</i>) Judge her, Bluntschli—you,
the moderate, cautious man: judge the eavesdropper.
</p>

<p class="stage">
(<i>Louka stands her ground, proud and silent.</i>)
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BLUNTSCHLI.<br />
(<i>shaking his head</i>). I mustn’t judge her. I once listened myself
outside a tent when there was a mutiny brewing. It’s all a question of
the degree of provocation. My life was at stake.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
LOUKA.<br />
My love was at stake. (<i>Sergius flinches, ashamed of her in spite of
himself.</i>) I am not ashamed.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
(<i>contemptuously</i>). Your love! Your curiosity, you mean.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
LOUKA.<br />
(<i>facing her and retorting her contempt with interest</i>). My love, stronger
than anything you can feel, even for your chocolate cream soldier.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SERGIUS.<br />
(<i>with quick suspicion—to Louka</i>). What does that mean?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
LOUKA.<br />
(<i>fiercely</i>). It means—
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SERGIUS.<br />
(<i>interrupting her slightingly</i>). Oh, I remember, the ice pudding. A
paltry taunt, girl.
</p>

<p class="stage">
(<i>Major Petkoff enters, in his shirtsleeves.</i>)
</p>

<p class="dialog">
PETKOFF.<br />
Excuse my shirtsleeves, gentlemen. Raina: somebody has been wearing that coat
of mine: I’ll swear it—somebody with bigger shoulders than mine.
It’s all burst open at the back. Your mother is mending it. I wish
she’d make haste. I shall catch cold. (<i>He looks more attentively at
them.</i>) Is anything the matter?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
No. (<i>She sits down at the stove with a tranquil air.</i>)
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SERGIUS.<br />
Oh, no! (<i>He sits down at the end of the table, as at first.</i>)
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BLUNTSCHLI.<br />
(<i>who is already seated</i>). Nothing, nothing.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
PETKOFF.<br />
(<i>sitting down on the ottoman in his old place</i>). That’s all right.
(<i>He notices Louka.</i>) Anything the matter, Louka?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
LOUKA.<br />
No, sir.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
PETKOFF.<br />
(<i>genially</i>). That’s all right. (<i>He sneezes.</i>) Go and ask your
mistress for my coat, like a good girl, will you? (<i>She turns to obey; but
Nicola enters with the coat; and she makes a pretence of having business in the
room by taking the little table with the hookah away to the wall near the
windows.</i>)
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
(<i>rising quickly, as she sees the coat on Nicola’s arm</i>). Here it
is, papa. Give it to me, Nicola; and do you put some more wood on the fire.
(<i>She takes the coat, and brings it to the Major, who stands up to put it on.
Nicola attends to the fire.</i>)
</p>

<p class="dialog">
PETKOFF.<br />
(<i>to Raina, teasing her affectionately</i>). Aha! Going to be very good to
poor old papa just for one day after his return from the wars, eh?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
(<i>with solemn reproach</i>). Ah, how can you say that to me, father?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
PETKOFF.<br />
Well, well, only a joke, little one. Come, give me a kiss. (<i>She kisses
him.</i>) Now give me the coat.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
Now, I am going to put it on for you. Turn your back. (<i>He turns his back and
feels behind him with his arms for the sleeves. She dexterously takes the
photograph from the pocket and throws it on the table before Bluntschli, who
covers it with a sheet of paper under the very nose of Sergius, who looks on
amazed, with his suspicions roused in the highest degree. She then helps
Petkoff on with his coat.</i>) There, dear! Now are you comfortable?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
PETKOFF.<br />
Quite, little love. Thanks. (<i>He sits down; and Raina returns to her seat
near the stove.</i>) Oh, by the bye, I’ve found something funny.
What’s the meaning of this? (<i>He put his hand into the picked
pocket.</i>) Eh? Hallo! (<i>He tries the other pocket.</i>) Well, I could have
sworn—(<i>Much puzzled, he tries the breast pocket.</i>) I
wonder—(<i>Tries the original pocket.</i>) Where can it—(<i>A light
flashes on him; he rises, exclaiming</i>) Your mother’s taken it.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
(<i>very red</i>). Taken what?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
PETKOFF.<br />
Your photograph, with the inscription: “Raina, to her Chocolate Cream
Soldier—a souvenir.” Now you know there’s something more in
this than meets the eye; and I’m going to find it out. (<i>Shouting</i>)
Nicola!
</p>

<p class="dialog">
NICOLA.<br />
(<i>dropping a log, and turning</i>). Sir!
</p>

<p class="dialog">
PETKOFF.<br />
Did you spoil any pastry of Miss Raina’s this morning?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
NICOLA.<br />
You heard Miss Raina say that I did, sir.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
PETKOFF.<br />
I know that, you idiot. Was it true?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
NICOLA.<br />
I am sure Miss Raina is incapable of saying anything that is not true, sir.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
PETKOFF.<br />
Are you? Then I’m not. (<i>Turning to the others.</i>) Come: do you think
I don’t see it all? (<i>Goes to Sergius, and slaps him on the
shoulder.</i>) Sergius: you’re the chocolate cream soldier, aren’t
you?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SERGIUS.<br />
(<i>starting up</i>). I! a chocolate cream soldier! Certainly not.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
PETKOFF.<br />
Not! (<i>He looks at them. They are all very serious and very conscious.</i>)
Do you mean to tell me that Raina sends photographic souvenirs to other men?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SERGIUS.<br />
(<i>enigmatically</i>). The world is not such an innocent place as we used to
think, Petkoff.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BLUNTSCHLI.<br />
(<i>rising</i>). It’s all right, Major. I’m the chocolate cream
soldier. (<i>Petkoff and Sergius are equally astonished.</i>) The gracious
young lady saved my life by giving me chocolate creams when I was
starving—shall I ever forget their flavour! My late friend Stolz told you
the story at Peerot. I was the fugitive.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
PETKOFF.<br />
You! (<i>He gasps.</i>) Sergius: do you remember how those two women went on
this morning when we mentioned it? (<i>Sergius smiles cynically. Petkoff
confronts Raina severely.</i>) You’re a nice young woman, aren’t
you?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
(<i>bitterly</i>). Major Saranoff has changed his mind. And when I wrote that
on the photograph, I did not know that Captain Bluntschli was married.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BLUNTSCHLI.<br />
(<i>much startled protesting vehemently</i>). I’m not married.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
(<i>with deep reproach</i>). You said you were.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BLUNTSCHLI.<br />
I did not. I positively did not. I never was married in my life.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
PETKOFF.<br />
(<i>exasperated</i>). Raina: will you kindly inform me, if I am not asking too
much, which gentleman you are engaged to?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
To neither of them. This young lady (<i>introducing Louka, who faces them all
proudly</i>) is the object of Major Saranoff’s affections at present.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
PETKOFF.<br />
Louka! Are you mad, Sergius? Why, this girl’s engaged to Nicola.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
NICOLA.<br />
(<i>coming forward </i>). I beg your pardon, sir. There is a mistake. Louka is
not engaged to me.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
PETKOFF.<br />
Not engaged to you, you scoundrel! Why, you had twenty-five levas from me on
the day of your betrothal; and she had that gilt bracelet from Miss Raina.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
NICOLA.<br />
(<i>with cool unction</i>). We gave it out so, sir. But it was only to give
Louka protection. She had a soul above her station; and I have been no more
than her confidential servant. I intend, as you know, sir, to set up a shop
later on in Sofia; and I look forward to her custom and recommendation should
she marry into the nobility. (<i>He goes out with impressive discretion,
leaving them all staring after him.</i>)
</p>

<p class="dialog">
PETKOFF.<br />
(<i>breaking the silence</i>). Well, I am—-hm!
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SERGIUS.<br />
This is either the finest heroism or the most crawling baseness. Which is it,
Bluntschli?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BLUNTSCHLI.<br />
Never mind whether it’s heroism or baseness. Nicola’s the ablest
man I’ve met in Bulgaria. I’ll make him manager of a hotel if he
can speak French and German.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
LOUKA.<br />
(<i>suddenly breaking out at Sergius</i>). I have been insulted by everyone
here. You set them the example. You owe me an apology. (<i>Sergius immediately,
like a repeating clock of which the spring has been touched, begins to fold his
arms.</i>)
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BLUNTSCHLI.<br />
(<i>before he can speak</i>). It’s no use. He never apologizes.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
LOUKA.<br />
Not to you, his equal and his enemy. To me, his poor servant, he will not
refuse to apologize.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SERGIUS.<br />
(<i>approvingly</i>). You are right. (<i>He bends his knee in his grandest
manner.</i>) Forgive me!
</p>

<p class="dialog">
LOUKA.<br />
I forgive you. (<i>She timidly gives him her hand, which he kisses.</i>) That
touch makes me your affianced wife.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SERGIUS.<br />
(<i>springing up</i>). Ah, I forgot that!
</p>

<p class="dialog">
LOUKA.<br />
(<i>coldly</i>). You can withdraw if you like.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SERGIUS.<br />
Withdraw! Never! You belong to me! (<i>He puts his arm about her and draws her
to him.</i>) (<i>Catherine comes in and finds Louka in Sergius’s arms,
and all the rest gazing at them in bewildered astonishment.</i>)
</p>

<p class="dialog">
CATHERINE.<br />
What does this mean? (<i>Sergius releases Louka.</i>)
</p>

<p class="dialog">
PETKOFF.<br />
Well, my dear, it appears that Sergius is going to marry Louka instead of
Raina. (<i>She is about to break out indignantly at him: he stops her by
exclaiming testily.</i>) Don’t blame me: I’ve nothing to do with
it. (<i>He retreats to the stove.</i>)
</p>

<p class="dialog">
CATHERINE.<br />
Marry Louka! Sergius: you are bound by your word to us!
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SERGIUS.<br />
(<i>folding his arms</i>). Nothing binds me.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BLUNTSCHLI.<br />
(<i>much pleased by this piece of common sense</i>). Saranoff: your hand. My
congratulations. These heroics of yours have their practical side after all.
(<i>To Louka.</i>) Gracious young lady: the best wishes of a good Republican!
(<i>He kisses her hand, to Raina’s great disgust.</i>)
</p>

<p class="dialog">
CATHERINE.<br />
(<i>threateningly</i>). Louka: you have been telling stories.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
LOUKA.<br />
I have done Raina no harm.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
CATHERINE.<br />
(<i>haughtily</i>). Raina! (<i>Raina is equally indignant at the liberty.</i>)
</p>

<p class="dialog">
LOUKA.<br />
I have a right to call her Raina: she calls me Louka. I told Major Saranoff she
would never marry him if the Swiss gentleman came back.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BLUNTSCHLI.<br />
(<i>surprised</i>). Hallo!
</p>

<p class="dialog">
LOUKA.<br />
(<i>turning to Raina</i>). I thought you were fonder of him than of Sergius.
You know best whether I was right.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BLUNTSCHLI.<br />
What nonsense! I assure you, my dear Major, my dear Madame, the gracious young
lady simply saved my life, nothing else. She never cared two straws for me.
Why, bless my heart and soul, look at the young lady and look at me. She, rich,
young, beautiful, with her imagination full of fairy princes and noble natures
and cavalry charges and goodness knows what! And I, a common-place Swiss
soldier who hardly knows what a decent life is after fifteen years of barracks
and battles—a vagabond—a man who has spoiled all his chances in
life through an incurably romantic disposition—a man—
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SERGIUS.<br />
(<i>starting as if a needle had pricked him and interrupting Bluntschli in
incredulous amazement</i>). Excuse me, Bluntschli: what did you say had spoiled
your chances in life?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BLUNTSCHLI.<br />
(<i>promptly</i>). An incurably romantic disposition. I ran away from home
twice when I was a boy. I went into the army instead of into my father’s
business. I climbed the balcony of this house when a man of sense would have
dived into the nearest cellar. I came sneaking back here to have another look
at the young lady when any other man of my age would have sent the coat
back—
</p>

<p class="dialog">
PETKOFF.<br />
My coat!
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BLUNTSCHLI.—Yes: that’s the coat I mean—would have sent it
back and gone quietly home. Do you suppose I am the sort of fellow a young girl
falls in love with? Why, look at our ages! I’m thirty-four: I don’t
suppose the young lady is much over seventeen. (<i>This estimate produces a
marked sensation, all the rest turning and staring at one another. He proceeds
innocently.</i>) All that adventure which was life or death to me, was only a
schoolgirl’s game to her—chocolate creams and hide and seek.
Here’s the proof! (<i>He takes the photograph from the table.</i>) Now, I
ask you, would a woman who took the affair seriously have sent me this and
written on it: “Raina, to her chocolate cream soldier—a
souvenir”? (<i>He exhibits the photograph triumphantly, as if it settled
the matter beyond all possibility of refutation.</i>)
</p>

<p class="dialog">
PETKOFF.<br />
That’s what I was looking for. How the deuce did it get there?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BLUNTSCHLI.<br />
(<i>to Raina complacently</i>). I have put everything right, I hope, gracious
young lady!
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
(<i>in uncontrollable vexation</i>). I quite agree with your account of
yourself. You are a romantic idiot. (<i>Bluntschli is unspeakably taken
aback.</i>) Next time I hope you will know the difference between a schoolgirl
of seventeen and a woman of twenty-three.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BLUNTSCHLI.<br />
(<i>stupefied</i>). Twenty-three! (<i>She snaps the photograph contemptuously
from his hand; tears it across; and throws the pieces at his feet.</i>)
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SERGIUS.<br />
(<i>with grim enjoyment of Bluntschli’s discomfiture</i>). Bluntschli: my
one last belief is gone. Your sagacity is a fraud, like all the other things.
You have less sense than even I have.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BLUNTSCHLI.<br />
(<i>overwhelmed</i>). Twenty-three! Twenty-three!! (<i>He considers.</i>) Hm!
(<i>Swiftly making up his mind.</i>) In that case, Major Petkoff, I beg to
propose formally to become a suitor for your daughter’s hand, in place of
Major Saranoff retired.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
You dare!
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BLUNTSCHLI.<br />
If you were twenty-three when you said those things to me this afternoon, I
shall take them seriously.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
CATHERINE.<br />
(<i>loftily polite</i>). I doubt, sir, whether you quite realize either my
daughter’s position or that of Major Sergius Saranoff, whose place you
propose to take. The Petkoffs and the Saranoffs are known as the richest and
most important families in the country. Our position is almost historical: we
can go back for nearly twenty years.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
PETKOFF.<br />
Oh, never mind that, Catherine. (<i>To Bluntschli.</i>) We should be most
happy, Bluntschli, if it were only a question of your position; but hang it,
you know, Raina is accustomed to a very comfortable establishment. Sergius
keeps twenty horses.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BLUNTSCHLI.<br />
But what on earth is the use of twenty horses? Why, it’s a circus.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
CATHERINE.<br />
(<i>severely</i>). My daughter, sir, is accustomed to a first-rate stable.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
Hush, mother, you’re making me ridiculous.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BLUNTSCHLI.<br />
Oh, well, if it comes to a question of an establishment, here goes! (<i>He goes
impetuously to the table and seizes the papers in the blue envelope.</i>) How
many horses did you say?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SERGIUS.<br />
Twenty, noble Switzer!
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BLUNTSCHLI.<br />
I have two hundred horses. (<i>They are amazed.</i>) How many carriages?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SERGIUS.<br />
Three.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BLUNTSCHLI.<br />
I have seventy. Twenty-four of them will hold twelve inside, besides two on the
box, without counting the driver and conductor. How many tablecloths have you?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SERGIUS.<br />
How the deuce do I know?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BLUNTSCHLI.<br />
Have you four thousand?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SERGIUS.<br />
NO.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BLUNTSCHLI.<br />
I have. I have nine thousand six hundred pairs of sheets and blankets, with two
thousand four hundred eider-down quilts. I have ten thousand knives and forks,
and the same quantity of dessert spoons. I have six hundred servants. I have
six palatial establishments, besides two livery stables, a tea garden and a
private house. I have four medals for distinguished services; I have the rank
of an officer and the standing of a gentleman; and I have three native
languages. Show me any man in Bulgaria that can offer as much.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
PETKOFF.<br />
(<i>with childish awe</i>). Are you Emperor of Switzerland?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BLUNTSCHLI.<br />
My rank is the highest known in Switzerland: I’m a free citizen.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
CATHERINE.<br />
Then Captain Bluntschli, since you are my daughter’s choice, I shall not
stand in the way of her happiness. (<i>Petkoff is about to speak.</i>) That is
Major Petkoff’s feeling also.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
PETKOFF.<br />
Oh, I shall be only too glad. Two hundred horses! Whew!
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SERGIUS.<br />
What says the lady?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
(<i>pretending to sulk</i>). The lady says that he can keep his tablecloths and
his omnibuses. I am not here to be sold to the highest bidder.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BLUNTSCHLI.<br />
I won’t take that answer. I appealed to you as a fugitive, a beggar, and
a starving man. You accepted me. You gave me your hand to kiss, your bed to
sleep in, and your roof to shelter me—
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
(<i>interrupting him</i>). I did not give them to the Emperor of Switzerland!
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BLUNTSCHLI.<br />
That’s just what I say. (<i>He catches her hand quickly and looks her
straight in the face as he adds, with confident mastery</i>) Now tell us who
you did give them to.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
RAINA.<br />
(<i>succumbing with a shy smile</i>). To my chocolate cream soldier!
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BLUNTSCHLI.<br />
(<i>with a boyish laugh of delight</i>). That’ll do. Thank you. (<i>Looks
at his watch and suddenly becomes businesslike.</i>) Time’s up, Major.
You’ve managed those regiments so well that you are sure to be asked to
get rid of some of the Infantry of the Teemok division. Send them home by way
of Lom Palanka. Saranoff: don’t get married until I come back: I shall be
here punctually at five in the evening on Tuesday fortnight. Gracious
ladies—good evening. (<i>He makes them a military bow, and goes.</i>)
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SERGIUS.<br />
What a man! What a man!
